A simple matrix is given for species in which adult mortality and fertility are independent of age, but in which the juvenile mortality rate differs from the adult. The population vector can be changed into a population matrix. This should allow equations using functions of the size of the population to be developed. Genetic variables such as sex or other polymorphisms can be introduced, and the notation allows different systems of selection or non-random mating to be specified.},

abstract = {While there has been extensive interest in how intraspecific trait variation affects ecological processes, outcomes are highly variable even when individuals are identical: some are lucky, while others are not. Trait variation is therefore important only if it adds substantially to the variability produced by luck. We ask when trait variation has a substantial effect on variability in lifetime reproductive success (LRS), using two approaches: (1) we partition the variation in LRS into contributions from luck and trait variation and (2) we ask what can be inferred about an individual's traits and with what certainty, given their observed LRS. In theoretical stage- and size-structured models and two empirical case studies, we find that luck usually dominates the variance of LRS. Even when individuals differ substantially in ways that affect expected LRS, unless the effects of luck are substantially reduced (e.g., low variability in reproductive life span or annual fecundity), most variance in lifetime outcomes is due to luck, implying that departures from “null” models omitting trait variation will be hard to detect. Luck also obscures the relationship between realized LRS and individual traits. While trait variation may influence the fate of populations, luck often governs the lives of individuals.},
annote = {https://www.amnat.org/an/newpapers/AprSnyder.html


"What makes highly successful individuals (those living a long time or producing many offspring over their lives) successful? How much of it is due to being special (having traits associated with high fitness) and how much of it is due to being lucky? Similarly, if we observe a highly successful individual, what can we conclude about their likely traits and with what confidence? Snyder and Ellner show how to define and answer these questions mathematically and apply their analyses to a series of case studies and models of varying complexity. For reasonable parameter choices, they find that most of success is about luck, not having high-fitness traits. Along the same line, having high-fitness traits is often necessary but not sufficient for being highly successful—an individual also needs to be lucky. These findings leave evolutionary dynamics intact—beneficial traits will spread by natural selection in populations large enough for luck to average out. However, when population-level ecological outcomes (such as birth rate or prey capture rate) are dominated by luck, within-population trait variation may be difficult to detect and may not contribute much to explaining ecological patterns."},

abstract = {The evolution of quantitative characters can be described by the equation Deltaz=GP-1S where Deltaz is the vector of mean responses, G is the matrix of additive genetic variances and covariances, P is the matrix of phenotypic variances and covariances and S is the vector of selection differentials. This equation can be used to predict changes in trait values or to retrospectively estimate the selection gradient and is thus a central equation of evolutionary quantitative genetics. Genetic variances and covariances will be reduced by stabilizing selection, directional selection and drift, and increased by mutation. Changes in trait values resulting from directional selection that are comparable with differences observed among species are readily obtainable in short geological time spans ({\textless}5000 generations) with selection intensities so small that they would have an insignificant effect on the G matrix (of course it is possible that such changes came about by strong selection over a few generations, followed by long periods of stasis; there is insufficient evidence to presently distinguish these two possibilities). On the other hand, observed effective population sizes are sufficiently small that considerable changes in G can be expected from drift alone. The action of drift can be distinguished from selection because the former produces a proportional change in G whereas the latter, in general, will not. A survey of studies examining variation in G suggests that the null hypothesis that most of the variation can be attributed to drift rather than selection cannot be rejected. However, more research on the predicted statistical distribution of G as a result of selection and/or drift is required and further development of statistical tests to distinguish these two forces needs to be made.},

abstract = {The alveolar structure, a space-filling branching duct system with alveolar openings, is one of the most complicated structures in the living body. Although its deformation during ventilation is the basic knowledge for lung physiology, there has been no consensus on it because of technical difficulties of dynamic 3-dimensional observation in vivo. It is known that the alveolar duct wall (primary septa) in the fetal lung is deformed so as to obtain the largest inner space and the widest surface area, and that the secondary septa grow just before birth and their free ridges form the alveolar entrance rings (mouths) containing abundant elastin fibers. We have constructed a 4-dimensional alveolar model according to this morphogenetic process, where the alveolar deformation is modeled by a combination of springs and hinges, corresponding to elastin fibers at alveolar mouths and junctions of alveolar septa, respectively. The model includes a hypothesis that alveolar mouths are closed at minimum volume and that closed alveoli are stabilized by the alveolar lining liquid film containing a surfactant. Morphometric characteristics of the model were consistent with previous reports. Furthermore, the model explained how the alveolar number and size could change during ventilation. Using in vivo microscopy, we validated our model by an analysis of the dynamic inflation and deflation of subpleural alveoli. Our model, including the alveolar mouth-closure hypothesis, can explain the origin of phase IV in a single breath nitrogen washout curve (closing volume) and mechanism of alveolar recruitment/derecruitment.},

abstract = {1. Theoretical models pertaining to feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes are prevalent in multiple biological fields. An integrative overview is currently lacking, due to little crosstalk between the fields and the use of different methodological approaches. 2. Here we review a wide range of models of eco-evolutionary feedbacks and highlight their underlying assumptions. We discuss models where feedbacks occur both within and between hierarchical levels of ecosystems, including populations, communities, and abiotic environments, and consider feedbacks across spatial scales. 3. Identifying the commonalities among feedback models, and the underlying assumptions, helps us better understand the mechanistic basis of eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks can be readily modelled by coupling demographic and evolutionary formalisms. We provide an overview of these approaches and suggest future integrative modelling avenues. 4. Our overview highlights that eco-evolutionary feedbacks have been incorporated in theoretical work for nearly a century. Yet, this work does not always include the notion of rapid evolution or concurrent ecological and evolutionary time scales. We discuss the importance of density- and frequency-dependent selection for feedbacks, as well as the importance of dispersal as a central linking trait between ecology and evolution in a spatial context.},

Coasts and estuaries contain among the most productive and ecologically important habitats in the world and face intense pressure from current and projected human activities, including coastal development. Seagrasses are a key habitat feature in many estuaries perceived to be in widespread decline owing to human actions. 2. We use spatio-temporal models and a 41-year time series from 100s of km of shoreline which includes over 160 000 observations from Puget Sound, Washington, USA, to examine multiscale trends and drivers of eelgrass (Zostera spp.) change in an urbanizing estuary. 3. At whole estuary scale (100s of km), we find a stable and resilient eelgrass population despite a more than doubling of human population density and multiple major climactic stressors (e.g. ENSO events) over the period. However, the aggregate trend is not reflected at the site scale (10s of km), where some sites persistently increase while others decline. 4. Site trends were spatially asynchronous; adjacent sites sometimes exhibited opposite trends over the same period. Substantial change in eelgrass occurred at the subsite (01 km) scale, including both complete local loss and dramatic increase of eelgrass. 5.

abstract = {Longevity has long been recognised as a key facilitator of reciprocal altruism because 1 repeated cooperation of partners hinges on mutual survival. Although demographic 2 tools can be used to quantify mutual survival and expected overlapping lifespans, 3 studies on the evolutionary theory of cooperation take only limited advantage of 4 demography. Overlap of lifespans depends on variation in survival across ages and can 5 be high or low independently of high or low life expectancies. Here we develop formal 6 demographic measures to study the complex relationships between shared life 7 expectancy of two birth cohort peers, the proportion of their lives that they can expect 8 to overlap, and longevity. We simulate age-specific mortality schedules using a Siler 9 model to reveal how infant and senescent mortality, along with age-independent 10 mortality, affect the relationship between the proportion of life shared and life 11 expectancy. We find that while the proportion of life shared can vary vastly for similar 12 life expectancies, almost all changes to mortality schedules that result in higher life 13 expectancies also result in higher proportions of life shared. A distinct exception occurs 14 if life expectancy increases due to lowering the rate of senescence. In this case the 15 proportion of life shared decreases. Our work shows that almost all selective pressures 16 that result in higher life expectancies also result in a larger proportion of life shared. 17 Therefore, selective forces that extend life also improve the chances that a cooperative 18 system would be stable in terms of reciprocal interactions. Since reciprocal interactions 19 may also reduce mortality and result in a feedback loop with the evolution of longevity, 20 our measures and findings can be used for future cross-species comparisons that aim to 21 disentangle predecessor and successor in the evolution of longevity and cooperation.},

One common trade-off is that between competitive ability and resistance to predators, parasitoids, pathogens or herbivores. We used a microbial experimental system to elucidate the shape of the relationship between parasitoid resistance and competitive ability. For each of 86 bacteriophage-resistant isolates of the bacterium Escherichia coli B, we measured the degree of resistance to bacteriophage T2 (a viral parasitoid) and relative competitive ability in both the resource environment in which strains were isolated and in two alternate environments. We observed that environmental change can alter trade-off shape, and that different physiological mechanisms can lead to different trade-off shapes and different sensitivities to environmental change. These results highlight the important interaction between environment and trade-off shape in affecting ecological and evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory networks, cellular biochemistry, tissue function, and whole body physiology are imbued with myriad overlapping and interacting homeostatic mechanisms that ensure that many phenotypes are robust to genetic and environmental variation. Animals also often have plastic responses to environmental variables, which means that many different phenotypes can correspond to a single genotype. Since natural selection acts on phenotypes, this raises the question of how selection can act on the genome if genotypes are decoupled from phenotypes by robustness and plasticity mechanisms. The answer can be found in the systems biology of the homeostatic mechanisms themselves. First, all such mechanisms operate over a limited range and outside that range the controlled variable changes rapidly allowing natural selection to act. Second, mutations and environmental stressors can disrupt homeostatic mechanisms, exposing cryptic genetic variation and allowing natural selection to act. We illustrate these ideas by examining the systems biology of four specific examples. We show how it is possible to analyze and visualize the roles of specific genes and specific polymorphisms in robustness in the context of large and realistic nonlinear systems. We also describe a new method, system population models, that allows one to connect causal dynamics to the variable outcomes that one sees in biological populations with large variation.},

We use haplotype-based statistical methods to analyse genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from a carefully chosen geographically diverse sample of 2,039 individuals from the United Kingdom. This reveals a rich and detailed pattern of genetic differentiation with remarkable concordance between genetic clusters and geography. The regional genetic differentiation and differing patterns of shared ancestry with 6,209 individuals from across Europe carry clear signals of historical demographic events. We estimate the genetic contribution to southeastern England from Anglo-Saxon migrations to be under half, and identify the regions not carrying genetic material from these migrations. We suggest significant pre-Roman but post-Mesolithic movement into southeastern England from continental Europe, and show that in non-Saxon parts of the United Kingdom, there exist genetically differentiated subgroups rather than a general ‘Celtic' population.},

abstract = {1. Energetics of reproduction in birds is reviewed with the question in mind how the parent adjusts its effort in relation to prevailing environmental conditions in order to maximize the output of young in its lifetime. Emphasis is on proximate controls, rather than ultimate factors measurable in terms of adult survival and recruitment of young. 2. The decision to breed or not to breed is clearly related to body condition of the female, presumably because of the implications this has for survival. 3. Laying date and clutch size are likewise under the influence of female condition and can hence be modified by experiments involving supplementary feeding. Natural variation in these features may often be related to territory quality. 4. How the bird decides whether or not to commence a second brood is not clear, but in the Great Tit the habitat-related difference in incidence of second broods is functionally understandable when survival probabilities of birds at different times are considered. 5. A distinction is made between a "capital" and "income" model for translatting rates of change of female body condition into appropriate decisions on laying date and clutch size and experiments are suggested that discriminate between the two. 6. Lack's view that brood size is in an evolutionary sense adjusted in order to balance food requirement and foraging capacity of the parents is accepted, and growth rates in nidicolous birds are analysed to ascertain if a finer adjustment exists superimposed on the integer steps of brood adjustment. Critical for this analysis are groups of birds where broods of one are common, since only in these circumstances is growth adjustment the only strategy open to the parents. In common with other animals, growth rate is related to mature body size but within a category of adult weight clear examples can be found for retardation of growth rate in pelecaniform and charadriiform species with singleton broods. 7. Since daily energy requirement is related to nestling size and growth rate, retardation of growth is explicable as a strategy only in terms of reducing the daily commitment of the parents, not reducing the total cost of producing a nestling. 8. An additional economy in growth is to reduce the contribution of fat to the nestling body. 9. Implied in Lack's view of brood size is a limitation of parental foraging capacity, and the last section of the paper is devoted to exploration of the proximate factors delimiting what Royama terms the optimal working capacity of parents feeding young. Observations of parent starlings confronted with manipulated brood size suggest a limit on the time that can be devoted to energetically extravagant flight activity, rather than a shortage of absolute time. Beyond the limit to which stressed parents can be made to fly, body weight declines. 10. Preliminary data on energy metabolized daily by parents confronted with large broods conforms to the simplified view that parental effort on a sustained basis equates to energy mobilization equivalent to 4 B.M.R. units and it is suggested that this level of energy expenditure represents a proximal decision substrate for determining the optimal working capacity of the parent. 11. The paper ends with a plea for more research on the proximate controls of avian reproduction, and calls attention to the central importance of the protein bank to parental body condition.},

abstract = {The rate of reproduction, age at maturity and longevity vary widely among species. Most of this life-history variation falls on a slow-fast continuum, with low reproductive rate, slow development and long life span at one end and the opposite traits at the other end. The absence of alternative combinations of these variables implies constraint on the diversification of life histories, but the nature of this constraint remains elusive. Here, we argue that individual and adaptive responses to different environments are limited by physiological mechanisms. Although energy and materials allocations are important results of physiological tradeoffs, endocrine control mechanisms can produce incompatible physiological states that restrict life histories to a single dominant axis of variation. To approach the problem of life-history variation properly, studies should integrate behavior and physiology within the environmental and demographic contexts of selection.},

abstract = {Trypanosoma naviformis n. sp. is described from the African olive sunbird Cyanomitra olivacea in Ghana based on the morphology of its hematozoic trypomastigotes and partial sequences of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. This parasite belongs to the group of small non-striated avian trypanosomes ({\textless} 30 mu m in length in average) with the kinetoplast situated close to the posterior end of the body. Trypanosoma naviformis can be distinguished from other small avian trypanosomes due to its poorly visible flagellum, central position of its nucleus, and the symmetrically ( in relation to the nucleus) narrowing of both ends of the hematozoic trypomastigotes, which are boat-like in shape. Illustrations of trypomastigotes of the new species are given, and SSU rDNA lineages associated with this parasite are documented. This parasite has been reported in Ghana and Cameroon and was also found in the yellow-whiskered greenbul, Andropadus latirostris in these countries. It appears to be widespread in its range given the distribution of these bird species in Africa.},

abstract = {Although we have learned much about avian life histories during the 50 years since the seminal publications of David Lack, Alexander Skutch, and Reginald Moreau, we still do not have adequate explanations for some of the basic patterns of variation in life-history traits among birds. In part, this reflects two consequences of the predominance of evolutionary ecology thinking during the past three decades. First, by blurring the distinction between life-history traits and life-table variables, we have tended to divorce life histories from their environmental context, which forms the link between the life history and the life table. Second, by emphasizing constrained evolutionary responses to selective factors, we have set aside alternative explanations for observed correlations among life-history traits and life-table variables. Density-dependent feedback and independent evolutionary response to correlated aspects of the environment also may link traits through different mechanisms. Additionally, in some cases we have failed to evaluate quantitatively ideas that are com-pelling qualitatively, ignored or explained away relevant empirical data, and neglected log-ical implications of certain compelling ideas. Comparative analysis of avian life histories shows that species are distributed along a dominant slow-fast axis. Furthermore, among birds, annual reproductive rate and adult mortality are directly proportional to each other, requiring that pre-reproductive survival is approximately constant. This further implies that age at maturity increases dramatically with increasing adult survival rate. The significance of these correlations is obscure, particularly because survival and reproductive rates at each age include the effects of many life-history traits. For example, reproductive rate is deter-mined by clutch size, nesting success, season length, and nest-cycle length, each of which represents the outcome of many different interactions of an individual' s life-history traits with its environment. Resolution of the most basic issues raised by patterns of life histories clearly will require innovative empirical, modeling, and experimental approaches. However, the most fundamental change required at this time is a broadening of the evolutionary ecology paradigm to include a variety of alternative mechanisms for generating patterns of life-history variation.},

Animal personality has been proposed to emerge as an adaptation to individual differences in state variables, leading to the question of why individuals differ consistently in state. Recent theory emphasizes the role that positive feedbacks between state and behaviour can play in producing consistent among-individual covariance between state and behaviour, hence state-dependent personality. We review the role of feedbacks in recent models of adaptive personalities, and provide guidelines for empirical testing of model assumptions and predictions. We discuss the importance of the mediating effects of ecology on these feedbacks, and provide a roadmap for including state-behaviour feedbacks in behavioural ecology research.},

abstract = {The surname distribution of the population of Switzerland was studied using a sample of 1,702,000 private users registered for the year 1994 in the Helvetic Telephone Directory. These users were distributed in four linguistic areas, in 26 Cantons and 271 Communes of the Confederation. Estimates of unbiased random isonymy, of Fisher's alpha, an indicator of abundance of surnames converging to the allele effective number in standard genetic polymorphisms, and of Karlin-McGregor's v, an indicator of immigration rates, were calculated for each Commune, each Canton, each linguistic area and for the whole Confederation. The Commune with the highest value of alpha was Geneva (alpha = 5312) followed by Versoix (3713) and by the Communes of Vaud on the north shore of Lake Leman, Chavannes (3381), Montreux (3200), Nyon (3114) and Lausanne (3109). The Italian-speaking Communes of the Ticino were next. The lowest value (alpha = 29) was observed in Poschiavo, south of the Berninapass; alpha = 39 was observed in Einsiedeln (Schwyz); then Mels and Widnau (62 and 67, Canton of St Gallen), Frutingen in Bern (72), and Appenzell (80). Accordingly, the highest consanguinity values were observed in the Grisons and in the nucleus of the founding Cantons, while the lowest were observed in the Cantons of Geneva and Vaud, preferential areas of immigration to Switzerland from abroad. The effect of subdivision on isonymy is large at the Commune level, and decreases in Cantons and linguistic groups. French and Italian languages indicate minor, German and Romanisch major inbreeding.},

abstract = {La politique implique, de par son {\'{e}}tymologie m{\^{e}}me, un ancrage g{\'{e}}ographique et spatial ; les connotations socio-culturelles vont donc peser fortement sur la traduction du texte politique. Ce texte, nous proposons de l'{\'{e}}tudier sous sa forme br{\`{e}}ve, par le biais du lexique et plus pr{\'{e}}cis{\'{e}}ment des anthroponymes. Les noms d'hommes politiques ne sont en effet pas des anthroponymes anodins : l'homme politique est repr{\'{e}}sentatif, aux sens propre et figur{\'{e}}, d'un territoire, d'un parti, d'une organisation. Son nom a donc valeur de symbole. Il est aussi souvent inscrit dans l'histoire nationale. Il signifie plus que sa valeur premi{\`{e}}re de d{\'{e}}signation individuelle. Preuve en est le nombre d'anthroponymes politiques qui ont donn{\'{e}} lieu {\`{a}} des d{\'{e}}rivations adjectivales ou nominales entr{\'{e}}es dans l'usage. Au cin{\'{e}}ma, art ax{\'{e}} sur la repr{\'{e}}sentation sinon du r{\'{e}}el, du moins d'un r{\'{e}}el ou pr{\'{e}}tendu tel, ce type d'anthroponymes peut s'av{\'{e}}rer difficile {\`{a}} interpr{\'{e}}ter lorsque le film est propos{\'{e}} dans une version de doublage linguistique. Le code onomastique y rev{\^{e}}t poutant une importance fondamentale. Il participe {\`{a}} conf{\'{e}}rer une valeur d'authenticit{\'{e}} au sc{\'{e}}nario, mais il d{\'{e}}passe cette fonction premi{\`{e}}re : « Nommer n'est pas refl{\'{e}}ter les choses, c'est classer, d{\'{e}}finir, abstraire. Un signe n'a de r{\'{e}}f{\'{e}}rent qu'en situation de discours pr{\'{e}}cise. » (Cordesse et al., 1991 : 12). Dans le monde de Woody Allen, par exemple, les noms propres ont valeur de code socio-culturel, partag{\'{e}} {\`{a}} la fois par les protagonistes au sein de la di{\'{e}}g{\`{e}}se et par le cin{\'{e}}aste et son public originel. Allen les utilise le plus souvent en conversation, entre membres de l'intelligensia new-yorkaise. Marqueurs de connivence « lib{\'{e}}rale » au sens anglo-saxon du terme, ils leur permettent d'afficher un front commun anti-conservateur, {\`{a}} vis{\'{e}}e fr{\'{e}}quemment ironique. Leurs connotations peuvent alors poser des probl{\`{e}}mes de compr{\'{e}}hension au spectateur {\'{e}}tranger. Car le nom propre, en situation dialogique, implique une pr{\'{e}}supposition d'existence des individus d{\'{e}}sign{\'{e}}s qui soit partag{\'{e}}e par les interlocuteurs. Mais le bagage cognitif des spectateurs fran{\c{c}}ais et am{\'{e}}ricains n'inclut pas syst{\'{e}}matiquement cette m{\^{e}}me connaissance pr{\'{e}}alable, remettant en cause les possibilit{\'{e}}s d'interpr{\'{e}}tation du texte. Le traducteur audiovisuel va devoir rep{\'{e}}rer et re-cr{\'{e}}er pour le public du doublage les connotations port{\'{e}}es par ces locuteurs fictionnels, en fonction des comp{\'{e}}tences spectatoriales qu'il aura anticip{\'{e}}es. De ce fait, les anthroponymes politiques sont plus ambigus encore {\`{a}} traduire dans les films de d{\'{e}}but de carri{\`{e}}re d'Allen, ant{\'{e}}rieurs {\`{a}} la mondialisation. Cette {\'{e}}tude de cas compare ainsi les noms d'hommes politiques issus des VO et VD fran{\c{c}}aises de quatre films couvrant vingt ans de sa filmographie, Annie Hall (1977), Manhattan (1979), Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) et Deconstructing Harry (1997), pour analyser les strat{\'{e}}gies de leurs adaptateurs fran{\c{c}}ais face aux capacit{\'{e}}s d'accueil relatives des publics source et cible, en s'appuyant sur les th{\'{e}}ories de l'esth{\'{e}}tique de la r{\'{e}}ception et le concept de contrat de spectature.},

abstract = {We investigated the influence of age on survival and breeding rates in a long-lived species Rissa tridactyla using models with individual random effects permitting variation and covariation in fitness components among individuals. Differences in survival or breeding probabilities among individuals are substantial, and there was positive covariation between survival and breeding probability; birds that were more likely to survive were also more likely to breed, given that they survived. The pattern of age-related variation in these rates detected at the individual level differed from that observed at the population level. Our results provided confirmation of what has been suggested by other investigators: within-cohort phenotypic selection can mask senescence. Although this phenomenon has been extensively studied in humans and captive animals, conclusive evidence of the discrepancy between population-level and individual-level patterns of age-related variation in life-history traits is extremely rare in wild animal populations. Evolutionary studies of the influence of age on life-history traits should use approaches differentiating population level from the genuine influence of age: only the latter is relevant to theories of life-history evolution. The development of models permitting access to individual variation in fitness is a promising advance for the study of senescence and evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {Here we describe a statistical procedure called within-subject centering (not to be confused with grand-mean centering; e.g. Kreft et al. 1995). This simple technique can be used in mixed models to separate within-subject effects (i.e. phenotypically plastic or facultative behavioural responses) from between-subject effects (i.e. evolutionarily fixed behavioural responses based on the individual or its class). Such a separation is important as it allows us to distinguish between alternative biological hypotheses and prevents us from erroneously generalizing within-subject relationships to between-subject relationships, or vice versa. We claim no originality for this statistical technique, which is commonly used in the social sciences (e.g. Davis et al. 1961; Raudenbush 1989; Kreft et al. 1995; Snijders {\&} Bosker 1999; see also van de Pol {\&} Verhulst 2006). However, we offer it as a piece of overlooked statistical methodology that we think is crucial to many researchers in animal behaviour, and in various other areas of biology as well. We illustrate our explanation of the technique with several biological examples and simulated data, but this method is widely applicable and most readers will probably be able to identify appropriate examples from their own research.},

However, most studies report associations between age and, for example, reproduction based on cross-sectional comparisons, which may be confounded with progressive changes in phenotypic population composition. Unbiased estimation of patterns of age-dependent reproduction (or other traits) requires disentanglement of within-individual change (improvement, senescence) and between-individual change (selective appearance and disappearance). We introduce a new statistical model that allows patterns of variance and covariance to differ between levels of aggregation. Our approach is simpler than alternative methods and can quantify the relative contributions of within-and between-individual changes in one framework. We illustrate our model using data on a long-lived bird species, the oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus). We show that for different reproductive traits (timing of breeding and egg size), either within-individual improvement or selective appearance can result in a positive association between age and reproductive traits at the population level. Potential applications of our methodology are manifold because within- and between-individual patterns are likely to differ in many biological situations.},

abstract = {Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits brings together the diverse array of theoretical and empirical applications of quantitative genetics under one cover, in a way that is both comprehensive and accessible to anyone with a rudimentary understanding of statistics and genetics. What was originally envisioned as a single text has now become two, with the focus of this first book being on the basic biology and methods of analysis of quantitative characters. (The second book, Evolution and Selection of Quantitative Traits, will address the basic principles that govern the evolutionary dynamics of quantitative characters under the forces of mutation, random genetic drift, and natural and/or artificial selection, integrating the theory of evolution of such characters with existing empirical data from natural and domesticated plant and animal populations.) Written as a general text in quantitative genetics, the book will also be useful as a basic reference for the seasoned professional. Throughout, central theoretical concepts are developed from first principles. To aid the less statistically sophisticated reader, several chapters and appendices focus on the basic statistical tools needed to digest the book. Wherever possible, theoretical and analytical concepts are illustrated with empirical examples from diverse settings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThree major features of Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits distinguish it from earlier work. First, it reflects the explosive influx over the past few years of quantitative-genetic thinking into evolutionary biology. Second, in animal breeding, enormous strides have been made in the development of new techniques for estimating breeding values (for the purposes of identifying elite individuals in selection programs) and for estimating variance components from samples of complex pedigrees. In this text's last two chapters, the authors outline the basic principles of complex pedigree analysis, without getting bogged down in technical details. Third, Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits provides a broad overview of the newly emerging array of techniques for quantitative-trait loci (QTL) analysis, currently one of the most active fields of quantitative-genetic research.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nGenetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits contains numerous fully-worked examples and illustrations of theoretical concepts, as well as over 2,000 references with indices by subject, author, and organism. In addition, the authors maintain a World Wide Web site featuring up-to-date lists of computer programs and on-line resources, and added information on various topics presented in the text.},

abstract = {We analyze long-term evolutionary dynamics in a large class of life history models. The model family is characterized by discrete-time population dynamics and a finite number of individual states such that the life cycle can be described in terms of a population projection matrix. We allow an arbitrary number of demographic parameters to be subject to density-dependent population regulation and two or more demographic parameters to be subject to evolutionary change. Our aim is to identify structural features of life cycles and modes of population regulation that correspond to specific evolutionary dynamics. Our derivations are based on a fitness proxy that is an algebraically simple function of loops within the life cycle. This allows us to phrase the results in terms of properties of such loops which are readily interpreted biologically. The following results could be obtained. First, we give sufficient conditions for the existence of optimisation principles in models with an arbitrary number of evolving traits. These models are then classified with respect to their appropriate optimisation principle. Second, under the assumption of just two evolving traits we identify structural features of the life cycle that determine whether equilibria of the monomorphic adaptive dynamics (evolutionarily singular points) correspond to fitness minima or maxima. Third, for one class of frequency-dependent models, where optimisation is not possible, we present sufficient conditions that allow classifying singular points in terms of the curvature of the trade-off curve. Throughout the article we illustrate the utility of our framework with a variety of examples.},

abstract = {Allocation decisions depend on an organism's condition which can change with age. Two opposite changes in life-history traits are predicted in the presence of senescence: either an increase in breeding performance in late age associated with terminal investment or a decrease due to either life-history trade-offs between current breeding and future survival or decreased efficiency at old age. Age variation in several life-history traits has been detected in a number of species, and demographic performances of individuals in a given year are influenced by their reproductive state the previous year. Few studies have, however, examined state-dependent variation in life-history traits with aging, and they focused mainly on a dichotomy of successful versus failed breeding and non-breeding birds. Using a 50-year dataset on the long-lived quasi-biennial breeding wandering albatross, we investigated variations in life-history traits with aging according to a gradient of states corresponding to potential costs of reproduction the previous year (in ascending order): non-breeding birds staying at sea or present at breeding grounds, breeding birds that failed early, late or were successful. We used multistate models to study survival and decompose reproduction into four components (probabilities of return, breeding, hatching, and fledging), while accounting for imperfect detection. Our results suggest the possible existence of two strategies in the population: strict biennial breeders that exhibited almost no reproductive senescence and quasi-biennial breeders that showed an increased breeding frequency with a strong and moderate senescence on hatching and fledging probabilities, respectively. The patterns observed on survival were contrary to our predictions, suggesting an influence of individual quality rather than trade-offs between reproduction and survival at late ages. This work represents a step further into understanding the evolutionary ecology of senescence and its relationship with costs of reproduction at the population level. It paves the way for individual-based studies that could show the importance of intra-population heterogeneity in those processes.},

Using invertebrates in microcosms, we characterise phenotypic, population and evolutionary dynamics before, during and after exposure to a novel environment and harvesting over 20 generations. We demonstrate an evolved change in life-history traits (the age- and size-at-maturity, and survival to maturity) in response to selection caused by environmental change (wild to laboratory) and to harvesting (juvenile or adult). Life-history evolution, which drives changes in population growth rate and thus population dynamics, includes an increase in age-to-maturity of 76{\%} (from 12.5 to 22 days) in the unharvested populations as they adapt to the new environment. Evolutionary responses to harvesting are outweighed by the response to environmental change ({\~{}} 1.4 vs. 4{\%} change in age-at-maturity per generation).

abstract = {How the neutral diversity is affected by selection and adaptation is investigated in an eco-evolutionary framework. In our model, we study a finite population in continuous time, where each individual is characterized by a trait under selection and a completely linked neutral marker. Population dynamics are driven by births and deaths, mutations at birth, and competition between individuals. Trait values influence ecological processes (demographic events, competition), and competition generates selection on trait variation, thus closing the eco-evolutionary feedback loop. The demographic effects of the trait are also expected to influence the generation and maintenance of neutral variation. We consider a large population limit with rare mutation, under the assumption that the neutral marker mutates faster than the trait under selection. We prove the convergence of the stochastic individual-based process to a new measure-valued diffusive process with jumps that we call Substitution Fleming-Viot Process (SFVP). When restricted to the trait space this process is the Trait Substitution Sequence first introduced by Metz et al. (1996). During the invasion of a favorable mutation, a genetical bottleneck occurs and the marker associated with this favorable mutant is hitchhiked. By rigorously analysing the hitchhiking effect and how the neutral diversity is restored afterwards, we obtain the condition for a time-scale separation; under this condition, we show that the marker distribution is approximated by a Fleming-Viot distribution between two trait substitutions. We discuss the implications of the SFVP for our understanding of the dynamics of neutral variation under eco-evolutionary feedbacks and illustrate the main phenomena with simulations. Our results highlight the joint importance of mutations, ecological parameters, and trait values in the restoration of neutral diversity after a selective sweep.},

abstract = {We address a conceptual flaw in the backward-time approach to population genetics called coalescent theory as it is applied to diploid biparental organisms. Specifically, the way random models of reproduction are used in coalescent theory is not justified. Instead, the population pedigree for diploid organisms—that is, the set of all family relationships among members of the population—although unknown, should be treated as a fixed parameter, not as a random quantity. Gene genealogical models should describe the outcome of the percolation of genetic lineages through the population pedigree according to Mendelian inheritance. Using simulated pedigrees, some of which are based on family data from 19th century Sweden, we show that in many cases the (conceptually wrong) standard coalescent model is difficult to reject statistically and in this sense may provide a surprisingly accurate description of gene genealogies on a fixed pedigree. We study the differences between the fixed-pedigree coalescent and the standard coalescent by analysis and simulations. Differences are apparent in recent past, within ∼ {\textless}log2(N) generations, but then disappear as genetic lineages are traced into the more distant past.},

It is shown that a Gompertz-type stochastic differential equation (SDE) model, involving asymmetric competition kernels and a stochastic term which decreases with the logarithm of plant weight, efficiently describes individual plant growth, competition, and variability in the studied population. The model is evaluated within a Bayesian framework and compared to its deterministic counterpart, and to several simplified stochastic models, using distributional validation. We show that stochasticity is an important determinant of size hierarchy and that SDE models outperform the deterministic model if and only if structural components of competition (asymmetry; size- and space-dependence) are accounted for.

abstract = {In most mammals, both sexes display different survival patterns, often involving faster senescence in males. Being under intense sexual competition to secure mating opportunities, males of polygynous species allocate resources to costly behaviors and conspicuous sexual traits, which might explain these observed differences in longevity and senescence patterns. However, comparative studies performed to date have led to conflicting results. We aimed to resolve this problem by first reviewing case studies of the relationship between the strength of sexual selection and age-specific survival metrics. Then, we performed a comprehensive comparative analysis to test whether such relationships exist among species of captive ruminants. We found that the strength of sexual selection negatively influenced the onset of actuarial senescence in males, with males senescing earlier in polygynous than in monogamous species, which led to reduced male longevity in polygynous species. Moreover, males of territorial species senesced earlier but slower, and have a shorter longevity than males of species displaying other mating tactics. We detected little influence of the strength of sexual selection on the rate of actuarial senescence. Our findings demonstrate that the onset of actuarial senescence, rather than its rate, is a side effect of physiological mechanisms linked to sexual selection, and potentially accounts for observed differences in longevity.},

abstract = {While life-history theory predicts a tradeoff between reproduction and survival, positive covariance, indicative of heterogeneity in individual quality, is often reported among individuals from natural populations. We review longitudinal studies of wild bird populations that test the relationship between annual reproductive success and lifespan and find the majority to report a positive correlation, while none reports a negative correlation. Heterogeneity in individual quality in resource acquisition, masking resource-based tradeoffs, therefore appears to be common in birds. Considering that there is little evidence for heritable variation in fitness, heterogeneity in individual quality among adults may be due to life-long effects of developmental conditions. In a 20-year case study on common terns Sterna hirundo, we test for life-long effects of cohort quality and within-cohort nest quality, but find no significant effects on long- term proxies of quality. Since other studies do find strong life-long effects of developmental conditions, we suggest that the brood reduction strategy adopted by common terns, causing the majority of offspring to die rapidly after hatching, efficiently reduces variation in offspring quality at independence. As such, a brood reduction strategy may contribute to reduced heterogeneity in adult survival in stochastic environments, both suggested to be more common and adaptive in long-lived species. Further study is required to assess heterogeneity in individual reproduction, especially in relation to environmental stochasticity and species' life-history strategies, in order to assess whether the relative strength of selection in early and late life may indeed affect the magnitude of heterogeneity in individual quality over life, and how this is mediated by parent–offspring conflict. ‘This},

abstract = {Population stage structure is fundamental to ecology, and models of this structure have proven useful in many different systems. Many ecological variables other than stage, such as habitat type, site occupancy and metapopulation status are also modelled using transitions among discrete states. Transitions among life stages can be characterised by the distribution of time spent in each stage, including the mean and variance of each stage duration and within-individual correlations among multiple stage durations. Three modelling traditions represent stage durations differently. Matrix models can be derived as a long-run approximation from any distribution of stage durations, but they are often interpreted directly as a Markov model for stage transitions. Statistical stage-duration distribution models accommodate the variation typical of cohort development data, but such realism has rarely been incorporated in population theory or statistical population models. Delay-differential equation models include lags but no variation, except in limited cases. We synthesise these models in one framework and illustrate how individual variation and correlations in development can impact population growth. Furthermore, different development models can yield the same long-term matrix transition rates but different sensitivities and elasticities. Finally, we discuss future directions for estimating realistic stage duration models from data.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Nordic Society Oikos. Alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) are examples of individual heterogeneity in which males adopt one of typically two alternative strategies to mate with females: males are either large, armed fighters or small, benign sneakers. ART expression is often conditionally determined, and variation in the expression of conditional ARTs due to genetic and/or environmental influences can greatly affect population composition and trajectory. For example, ecological feedback mechanisms resulting from strong density-dependent competition over food have been suggested to explain the observation that the harvesting of scramblers (= sneakers) in closed populations of the bulb mite Rhizoglyphus robini did not result in an increase (expected from quantitative genetics theory) but decrease in fighter expression. Here, we exposed closed bulb mite populations to selective fighter or scrambler harvesting for 5-6 generations under abundant food (to halt ecological feedbacks through density-dependence) to confirm predictions from quantitative genetics theory. However, we found no evolutionary shift in ART expression; rather, we observed an overcompensatory ecological response, whereby the number of fighters increased when we harvested them. Treatment effects on scrambler numbers could not be tested as there were too few in the experimental populations. Further experiments revealed that starved fighters preferentially killed immature males and immature fighters; possibly to reduce male-male competition as e.g. immature fighters have not yet developed their lethal weaponry. If this is so, then harvesting adult fighters reduced the killing pressure on immature males in our experiment, which resulted in an overcompensatory number of immature fighters that matured as adults. Our results highlight the complexity of how individual heterogeneity in ARTs affects the ecological and evolutionary processes that determine population fluctuations. Oikos},

abstract = {Heterosis, the superiority of hybrids over their parents for quantitative traits, represents a crucial issue in plant and animal breeding as well as evolutionary biology. Heterosis has given rise to countless genetic, genomic and molecular studies, but has rarely been investigated from the point of view of systems biology. We hypothesized that heterosis is an emergent property of living systems resulting from frequent concave relationships between genotypic variables and phenotypes, or between different phenotypic levels. We chose the enzyme-flux relationship as a model of the concave genotype-phenotype (GP) relationship, and showed that heterosis can be easily created in the laboratory. First, we reconstituted in vitro the upper part of glycolysis. We simulated genetic variability of enzyme activity by varying enzyme concentrations in test tubes. Mixing the content of " parental " tubes resulted in " hybrids, " whose fluxes were compared to the parental fluxes. Frequent heterotic fluxes were observed, under conditions that were determined analytically and confirmed by computer simulation. Second, to test this model in a more realistic situation, we modeled the glycolysis/fermentation network in yeast by considering one input flux, glucose, and two output fluxes, glycerol and acetaldehyde. We simulated genetic variability by randomly drawing parental enzyme concentrations under various conditions, and computed the parental and hybrid fluxes using a system of differential equations. Again we found that a majority of hybrids exhibited positive heterosis for metabolic fluxes. Cases of negative heterosis were due to local convexity between certain enzyme concentrations and fluxes. In both approaches, heterosis was maximized when the parents were phenotypically close and when the distributions of parental enzyme concentrations were contrasted and constrained. These conclusions are not restricted to metabolic systems: they only depend on the concavity of the GP relationship, which is commonly observed at various levels of the phenotypic hierarchy, and could account for the pervasiveness of heterosis.},

Here we re-emphasize the old standpoint that the genotype-phenotype (GP) relationship is best viewed as a connection between two differences, one at the genetic level and one at the phenotypic level. As of today, predominant thinking in biology research is that multiple genes interact with multiple environmental variables (such as abiotic factors, culture, or symbionts) to produce the phenotype. Often, the problem of linking genotypes and phenotypes is framed in terms of genotype and phenotype maps, and such graphical representations implicitly bring us away from the differential view of GP relationships. Here we show that the differential view of GP relationships is a useful explanatory framework in the context of pervasive pleiotropy, epistasis, and environmental effects. In such cases, it is relevant to view GP relationships as differences embedded into differences. Thinking in terms of differences clarifies the comparison between environmental and genetic effects on phenotypes and helps to further understand the connection between genotypes and phenotypes.},

abstract = {Horizontal transfer (HT) of heritable information or 'traits' (carried by genetic elements, plasmids, endosymbionts, or culture) is widespread among living organisms. Yet current ecological and evolutionary theory addressing HT is scant. We present a modeling framework for the dynamics of two populations that compete for resources and horizontally exchange (transfer) an otherwise vertically inherited trait. Competition influences individual demographics, thereby affecting population size, which feeds back on the dynamics of transfer. This feedback is captured in a stochastic individual-based model, from which we derive a general model for the contact rate, with frequency-dependent (FD) and density-dependent (DD) rates as special cases. Taking a large-population limit on the stochastic individual-level model yields a deterministic Lotka-Volterra competition system with additional terms accounting for HT. The stability analysis of this system shows that HT can revert the direction of selection: HT can drive invasion of a deleterious trait, or prevent invasion of an advantageous trait. Due to HT, invasion does not necessarily imply fixation. Two trait values may coexist in a stable polymorphism even if their invasion fitnesses have opposite signs, or both are negative. Addressing the question of how the stochasticity of individual processes influences population fluctuations, we identify conditions on competition and mode of transfer (FD versus DD) under which the stochasticity of transfer events overwhelms demographic stochasticity. Assuming that one trait is initially rare, we derive invasion and fixation probabilities and time. In the case of costly plasmids, which are transfered unilaterally, invasion is always possible if the transfer rate is large enough; under DD and for intermediate values of the transfer rate, maintenance of the plasmid in a polymorphic population is possible. In conclusion, HT interacts with ecology (competition) in non-trivial ways. Our model provides a basis to model the influence of HT on evolutionary adaptation.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the stochastic modeling of a general class of heterogeneous population dynamics structured by discrete subgroups. Such processes generalize classical multitype Birth-Death processes by allowing swap events, i.e. transfers from one subgroup to another. The variability of the environment is also included and the population evolution is not Markovian. We propose a new representation of the population based on its jump measure, characterized as a multivariate counting process with specific support conditions, and which together with the population defines a Birth-Death-Swap (BDS) system. We first prove a general result, on the construction by strong domination of multivariate counting processes solutions of stochastic differential equations driven by extended Poisson measures. Under weaker assumptions than usual, the existence of BDS systems strongly dominated by a Cox-Birth process is obtained. This pathwise comparison is the main tool to obtain tightness results in the second part of the paper. The BDS system in the presence of two timescales is then studied, when swap events occur at a faster timescale than demographic events. A general averaging result for the demographic counting process is proven. Classical averaging results obtained in the Markov case cannot be applied here, and in order to overcome this difficulty, we rely on the stable convergence of processes involved. This mode of convergence is particularly well-suited to our general framework. At the limit, the aggregated population is reduced to a one dimensional Birth-Death process with averaged intensities, resulting from a non-trivial aggregation of the subgroups birth and death intensities.},

abstract = {Mating in seed plants arises from interactions between plant traits and the environmental and demographic context in which individuals reside. These interactions commonly cause nonrandom mating, including selfing and promiscuous outcrossing within local neighborhoods. Shared features of seed plants, specifically immobility, hermaphroditism, and modularity, shape the essential character of mating mediated by animals, wind, and water. In addition, diverse floral strategies promote cross- and self-mating, depending on environmental circumstances. Extrinsic ecological factors influence all stages of the mating process—pollination, pollen-tube growth, ovule fertilization—as well as seed development, determining offspring quantity and quality. Traditionally, measures of plant mating systems have focused on a single axis of variation, the maternal outcrossing rate. Instead, we argue for an expanded perspective encompassing mating portfolios, which include all offspring to which individuals contribute genetically as maternal or paternal parents. This approach should expose key ecological determinants of mating-system variation and their evolutionary consequences.

abstract = {Pacific salmon include several species that are both commercially important and endangered. Understanding the causes of loss in genetic variation is essential for designing better conservation strategies. Here we use a coalescent approach to analyze a model of the complex life history of salmon, and derive the coalescent effective population (CES). With the aid of Kronecker products and a convergence theorem for Markov chains with two time scales, we derive a simple formula for the CES and thereby establish its existence. Our results may be used to address important questions regarding salmon biology, in particular about the loss of genetic variation. To illustrate the utility of our approach, we consider the effects of fluctuations in population size over time. Our analysis enables the application of several tools of coalescent theory to the case of salmon.},

We prove under the usual smoothness assumptions, starting from a stochastic birth and death process model, that, when advantageous mutations are rare and mutational steps are not too large, the population behaves on the mutational time scale (the 'long' time scale of the literature on the genetical foundations of ESS theory) as a jump process moving between homozygous states (the trait substitution sequence of the adaptive dynamics literature). Essential technical ingredients are a rigorous estimate for the probability of invasion in a dynamic diploid population, a rigorous, geometric singular perturbation theory based, invasion implies substitution theorem, and the use of the Skorohod M 1 topology to arrive at a functional convergence result. In the small mutational steps limit this process in turn gives rise to a differential equation in allele or in phenotype space of a type referred to in the adaptive dynamics literature as 'canonical equation'.},

abstract = {Recently, de-Camino-Beck and Lewis (Bull Math Biol 69:1341-1354, 2007) have presented a method that under certain restricted conditions allows computing the basic reproduction ratio R₀ in a simple manner from life cycle graphs, without, however, giving an explicit indication of these conditions. In this paper, we give various sets of sufficient and generically necessary conditions. To this end, we develop a fully algebraic counterpart of their graph-reduction method which we actually found more useful in concrete applications. Both methods, if they work, give a simple algebraic formula that can be interpreted as the sum of contributions of all fertility loops. This formula can be used in e.g. pest control and conservation biology, where it can complement sensitivity and elasticity analyses. The simplest of the necessary and sufficient conditions is that, for irreducible projection matrices, all paths from birth to reproduction have to pass through a common state. This state may be visible in the state representation for the chosen sampling time, but the passing may also occur in between sampling times, like a seed stage in the case of sampling just before flowering. Note that there may be more than one birth state, like when plants in their first year can already have different sizes at the sampling time. Also the common state may occur only later in life. However, in all cases R₀ allows a simple interpretation as the expected number of new individuals that in the next generation enter the common state deriving from a single individual in this state. We end with pointing to some alternative algebraically simple quantities with properties similar to those of R₀ that may sometimes be used to good effect in cases where no simple formula for R₀ exists.},

abstract = {Part of the art of theory building is to construct effective basic concepts, with a large reach and yet powerful as tools for getting at conclusions. The most basic concept of population biology is that of individual. An appropriately reengineered form of this concept has become the basis for the theories of structured populations and adaptive dynamics. By appropriately delimiting individuals, followed by defining their states as well as their environment, it become possible to construct the general population equations that were introduced and studied by Odo Diekmann and his collaborators. In this essay I argue for taking the properties that led to these successes as the defining characteristics of the concept of individual, delegating the properties classically invoked by philosophers to the secondary role of possible empirical indicators for the presence of those characteristics. The essay starts with putting in place as rule for effective concept engineering that one should go for relations that can be used as basis for deductive structure building rather than for perceived ontological essence. By analysing how we want to use it in the mathematical arguments I then build up a concept of individual, first for use in population dynamical considerations and then for use in evolutionary ones. These two concepts do not coincide, and neither do they on all occasions agree with common intuition-based usage.},

Correlations between measures were usually small, indicating that individuals may be considered high quality for one trait, but low quality for another. 4. By using principal component analysis, we illustrate that there are potentially many varied individual life-history tactics within a population. 5.

abstract = {The genetic correlation is a central parameter of quantitative genetics, providing a measure of the rate at which traits respond to indirect selection (i.e., selection that does not act upon the traits under study, but some other trait with which they have genes in common). In this paper, I review the pattern of variation among four combinations of traits: life history × life history (L × L), morphological × morphological (M × M), life history × morphological (L × M), and behavioral × behavioral (B × B). A few other combinations were investigated, but insufficient data were obtained for separate analysis. A total of 1798 correlations, distributed over 51 different animal and plant species, were analyzed. The analysis was conducted at two levels: first by dividing the data set solely by trait combination, and second by blocking the data by trait combination and species. Because selection will tend to fix alleles that show positive correlations with fitness traits faster than those that are negative and because the latter are expected to arise more frequently by mutation, correlations between life-history traits are predicted to be more often negative than those between morphological traits. This prediction was supported, with the ranking in decreasing proportion of negative correlations being: L × L {\textgreater} L × M {\textgreater} B × B {\textgreater} M × M. The mean magnitude of the genetic correlation shows little variation among morphological and life-history combinations, and the distribution of values is remarkably flat. However, the estimated standard errors and the coefficient of variation (SE/rG) are large, making it difficult to separate biological factors influencing the pattern of dispersion from experimental error. Analysis of the phenotypic and genetic correlations suggest that for the combinations M × M and L × M, but not L × L or B × B, the phenotypic correlation is an adequate estimate of the genetic correlation.},

abstract = {Whereas a life-history strategy is defined as a complex pattern of co-evolved lifehistory traits designed for a particular environment, a tactic is the plasticity of these traits that allows populations to cope with environmental variability. Strategies and tactics are sought by comparing traits from a large number of populations of different species. An autoregressive method allows partitioning the variability of demographic traits into two parts: a phylogenetic part (broad strategies inherited from the past) and a population part (the remaining variability, including tactics). The following traits are analysed: adult size as a scaling parameter because life-history traits are known to change with body size; survival, which accounts for fishing and natural mortality; age and size at maturity, and total reproductive output for an individual life-time. Data have been assembled for 67 stocks of four orders: Clupeiformes, Gadiformes, Perciformes, and Pleuronectiformes. It is concluded that these four orders have different life-history strategies, and that tactics are different among strategies. At low abundance, the compensations allowed by these tactics are much less efficient in Clupeiformes than in the other orders considered.},

abstract = {A life history tactic or strategy is usually defined as a set of coadapted reproduc- tive traits resulting from selection events in a specific environment (Stearns 1976). An extensive literature on selection regimes and their relationships to intraspecific variation in life history tactics has developed (see Stearns 1976). However, Stearns (1980) recently suggested several factors which may obscure the recogni- tion of life history tactics at the intraspecific level. Such life history tactics may be (1) constrained by allometric relationships, (2) subject to complex interactions with physiological, developmental, or behavioral variables, or (3) subject to genetic constraints. For these reasons, Stearns predicted that coadaptations of life history traits might be more obvious at higher taxonomic levels, and urged that comparative studies be carried out. Here I address some of these questions by comparing life history tactics at several taxonomic levels in freshwater snails. I define a life history tactic as a set of measurable reproductive traits (see below), and use discriminant analysis to contrast the separation of tactics (i.e., clustering of groups in discriminant space) at each taxonomic level. I also look for differences in tactics across habitat types, which one would expect if their selection regimes vary. Finally, I test whether covariation in life history traits is more obvious at higher taxonomic levels by comparing correlations of individual life history traits at both the population and family level.},

At evolutionary equilibrium, the linear combination of environmental variables that acts as a developmental cue for the plastic trait is the multivariate best linear predictor of changes in the optimum. However, the reaction norm with respect to any single environmental variable may exhibit nonintuitive patterns. Apparently maladaptive, or hyperadaptive plasticity can evolve with respect to single environmental variables, and costs of plasticity may increase, rather than reduce, plasticity in response to some variables. We also find conditions for the evolution of an indirect environmental indicator that affects expression of a plastic phenotype, despite not influencing natural selection on it.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 British Ecological Society. Comparative studies have demonstrated extensive variation in age trajectories of mortality and fecundity, both within and among species, with many taxa exhibiting a general pattern of age-related demographic decline referred to as senescence. Whereas a considerable body of theory is devoted to explaining the origin and persistence of senescence, the evolutionary forces underlying variation in demographic trajectories more generally remain poorly understood. Studying variation in demographic trajectories is complicated by the fact that different species (or even different populations of a given species) may live and reproduce on different time-scales, which, for comparative purposes, can make it challenging to disentangle patterns of age-related demographic change (the shape of demographic age trajectories) from the time-scale on which those changes happen (the pace of demographic age trajectories). Here, we examine variation in the pace and shape of demographic trajectories among strains of the aquatic plant Lemna turionifera Landolt from 24 sites across Alberta, Canada. Our main objectives were to describe the shape of demographic trajectories in L. turionifera, and test for among-strain variation in pace and shape. We also tested whether potential variation in pace and shape is (1) constrained by trade-offs with other life-history traits, and (2) consistent with local adaptation to environmental characteristics at the sites of strain origin. The strains we examined were overwhelmingly subject to age-related increases in mortality and declines in fecundity, with increases in mortality tending to decelerate and plateau at advanced ages. Despite substantial among-strain variation in cumulative fecundity and plant size, measures of pace and shape did not in themselves vary significantly among strains. Both within and among strains, we observed a negative relationship between plant size and the shape of fecundity trajectories, but we found no other evidence for life-history trade-offs involving pace or shape, nor for local adaptation. Synthesis. Angiosperms display remarkable demographic variation. Our results suggest that the pace and shape of demographic trajectories are highly conserved within one particular angiosperm species (Lemna turionifera), despite substantial among-strain variation in other life-history traits.},

abstract = {Understanding the genetic and environmental mechanisms governing variation in morphology or phenology in wild populations is currently an important challenge. While there is a general consensus that selection is stronger under stressful conditions, it remains unclear whether the evolutionary potential of traits should increase or decrease with increasingly stressful conditions. Here, we investigate how contrasting environmental conditions during growth may affect the maternal and genetic components of body mass in roe deer, the most abundant and widespread wild ungulate in Western Europe. Body mass is a key life history trait that strongly influences both survival and reproductive performance in large herbivores. We used pedigrees and animal models to determine the variance components of juvenile and adult winter body mass in two populations experiencing contrasting early-life conditions. Our analyses showed that roe deer at Chiz{\'{e}}, where habitat was poor and unpredictable, exhibited very low genetic variance in juvenile body mass. Instead, variance in mass was mainly driven by among-cohort differences in early-life conditions and maternal environment. In contrast, roe deer at Bogesund, where resource availability during the critical period of fawn rearing was higher, displayed a substantial level of genetic variance in body mass. We discuss the potential role of past demography and viability selection on fawn body mass on the erosion of genetic variance in the poor habitat. Our study highlights the importance of accounting for both spatial (i.e. between-population variation) and temporal (i.e. cohort variation) heterogeneity in environmental conditions, especially in early life, to understand the potential for adaptive responses of wild populations to selection.},

abstract = {In natural populations, individuals of a given genotype may belong to different classes. Such classes can represent different age groups, developmental stages, or habitats. Class structure has important evolutionary consequences because the fitness of individuals with the same genetic background may vary depending on their class. As a result, demographic transitions between classes can cause fluctuations in the trait mean that need to be removed when estimating selection on a trait. Intrinsic differences between classes are classically taken into account byweighting individuals by class-specific reproductive values, defined as the relative contribution of individuals in a given class to the future of the population. These reproductive values are generally constant weights calculated from a constant projection matrix. Here, I show for large populations and clonal reproduction that reproductive values can be defined as time-dependent weights satisfying dynamical demographic equations that depend only on the average between-class transition rates over all genotypes. Using these time-dependent demographic reproductive values yields a simple Price equation where the nonselective effects of between-class transitions are removed from the dynamics of the trait. This generalizes previous theory to a large class of ecological scenarios, taking into account density dependence, ecological feedbacks, arbitrary strength of selection, and arbitrary trait distributions. I discuss the role of reproductive values for prospective and retrospective analyses of the dynamics of phenotypic traits.},

abstract = {Stochastic factors affecting the demography of a single population are analyzed to determine the relative risks of extinction from demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity, and random catastrophes. Relative risks are assessed by comparing asymptotic scaling relationships describing how the average time to extinction, T, increases with the carrying capacity of a population, K, under each stochastic factor alone. Stochastic factors are added to a simple model of exponential growth up to K. A critical parameter affecting the extinction dynamics is {\$}\backslashtilde r,{\$} the long-run growth rate of a population below K, including stochastic factors. If r̃ is positive, with demographic stochasticity T increases asymptotically as a nearly exponential function of K, and with either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes T increases asymptotically as a power of K. If r̃ is negative, under any stochastic demographic factor, T increases asymptotically with the logarithm of K. Thus, for sufficiently large populations, the risk of extinction from demographic stochasticity is less important than that from either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes. The relative risks of extinction from environmental stochasticity and random catastrophes depend on the mean and environmental variance of population growth rate, and the magnitude and frequency of catastrophes. Contrary to previous assertions in the literature, a population of modest size subject to environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes can persist for a long time, if r̃ is substantially positive.},

We use matrix population models from 454 plant and animal populations to simulate stochastic population growth rates (log $\lambda$s) under different temporal autocorrelations in demographic rates, using simulated and observed covariation among rates. We then test for differences in sensitivities, or changes of log $\lambda$s to changes in autocorrelation among two major axes of life-history strategies, obtained from phylogenetically informed principal component analysis: the fast-slow and reproductive-strategy continua. Fast life histories exhibit highest sensitivities to simulated autocorrelation in demographic rates across reproductive strategies. Slow life histories are less sensitive to temporal autocorrelation, but their sensitivities increase among highly iteroparous species. We provide cross-taxonomic evidence that changes in the autocorrelation of environmental variation may affect a wide range of species, depending on complex interactions of life-history strategies.},

Accordingly, the current diverse range of statistical and demographic modelling strategies used for stochastic population modelling may influence predictions. * We used simulations to explore the effects of different methods of parameter estimation on projections of population dynamics obtained using stochastic integral projection models (IPMs). The simulations were built from data on a monocarpic thistle, Carlina vulgaris, and an ungulate, Soay sheep, Ovis aries; these populations are subject to yearly fluctuation in vital rates facilitating the exploration of the effects of different methods of model construction on the properties of stochastic IPMs. Specifically, we looked at effects on the stochastic growth rate, log $\lambda$s, and the mean and variance in the one-step population growth rate (Nt+1/Nt). * Our analyses showed that none of the tested approaches resulted in large biases in the estimation of log $\lambda$s. However, when realistic study durations (e.g. 12 years) were used for statistical modelling, the confidence intervals around the $\lambda$s estimates remained large. Estimation of the variance in one-step population growth rates, on the other hand, was strongly sensitive to the method employed, and the overestimation and underestimation of the variance were also influenced by the life history of the organism. * Our findings highlight the need to consider the influences of statistical and demographic modelling approaches when population dynamics have significant temporal stochasticity, as in population viability analyses and evolutionary predictions of bet hedging.},

@article{Sæther2007,
abstract = {Summary 1. Synchronous fluctuations of geographically separated populations are in general explained by the Moran effect, i.e. a common influence on the local population dynamics of environmental variables that are correlated in space. Empirical support for such a Moran effect has been difficult to provide, mainly due to problems separating out effects of local population dynamics, demographic stochasticity and dispersal that also influence the spatial scaling of population processes. Here we generalize the Moran effect by decomposing the spatial autocorrelation function for fluctuations in the size of great tit Parus major and blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus populations into components due to spatial correlations in the environmental noise, local differences in the strength of density regulation and the effects of demographic stochasticity. 2. Differences between localities in the strength of density dependence and nonlinearity in the density regulation had a small effect on population synchrony, whereas demographic stochasticity reduced the effects of the spatial correlation in environmental noise on the spatial correlations in population size by 21.7{\%} and 23.3{\%} in the great tit and blue tit, respectively. 3. Different environmental variables, such as beech mast and climate, induce a common environmental forcing on the dynamics of central European great and blue tit populations. This generates synchronous fluctuations in the size of populations located several hundred kilometres apart. 4. Although these environmental variables were autocorrelated over large areas, their contribution to the spatial synchrony in the population fluctuations differed, dependent on the spatial scaling of their effects on the local population dynamics. We also demonstrate that this effect can lead to the paradoxical result that a common environmental variable can induce spatial desynchronization of the population fluctuations. 5. This demonstrates that a proper understanding of the ecological consequences of environmental changes, especially those that occur simultaneously over large areas, will require information about the spatial scaling of their effects on local population dynamics.

abstract = {Darwin insisted that evolutionary change occurs very slowly over long periods of time, and this gradualist view was accepted by his supporters and incorporated into the infinitesimal model of quantitative genetics developed by R. A. Fisher and others. It dominated the first century of evolutionary biology, but has been challenged in more recent years both by field surveys demonstrating strong selection in natural populations and by quantitative trait loci and genomic studies, indicating that adaptation is often attributable to mutations in a few genes. The prevalence of strong selection seems inconsistent, however, with the high heritability often observed in natural populations, and with the claim that the amount of morphological change in contemporary and fossil lineages is independent of elapsed time. I argue that these discrepancies are resolved by realistic accounts of environmental and evolutionary changes. First, the physical and biotic environment varies on all time-scales, leading to an indefinite increase in environmental variance over time. Secondly, the intensity and direction of natural selection are also likely to fluctuate over time, leading to an indefinite increase in phenotypic variance in any given evolving lineage. Finally, detailed long-term studies of selection in natural populations demonstrate that selection often changes in direction. I conclude that the traditional gradualist scheme of weak selection acting on polygenic variation should be supplemented by the view that adaptation is often based on oligogenic variation exposed to commonplace, strong, fluctuating natural selection.},

abstract = {Many life-history traits, like the age at maturity or adult longevity, are important determinants of the generation time. For instance, semelparous species whose adults reproduce once and die have shorter generation times than iteroparous species that reproduce on several occasions. A shorter generation time ensures a higher growth rate in stable environments where resources are in excess, and is therefore a positively selected feature in this (rarely met) situation. In a stable and limiting environment, all combination of traits (or strategies) that produce the same number of viable offspring on average are strictly neutral even when their generation times differ. We first study the evolution of life-history strategies with different generation times in this context, and show that those with the longest generation time represent the most likely evolutionary outcomes. Indeed, strategies with longer generation times generate fewer mutants per time unit, which makes them less likely to be replaced within a given time period. This `turnover bias' inevitably exists and favors the evolution of strategies with long generation times. Its real impact, however, should depend on the strength and direction of other evolutionary forces; selection for short generation times, for instance, may oppose turnover bias. Likewise, the evolutionary outcome depends on the strength of such selection and population size, comparably to other biases acting on the occurrence of mutations.},

It is stressed that these equations are best viewed as approximations for more realistic, but often analytically intractable, models. A criterion is presented for determining which interpretation (e.g., Ito or Stratonovich) is likely to serve as the most useful approximation. Several limit theorems are presented which illustrate the use and implications of this criterion. In particular, it is shown that the solutions to sequences of models which approach a given SDE may converge to a diffusion process which corresponds to no solution of the SDE. However, arguing that in population biology the SDEs are generally serving as approximations to stochastic difference equations with autocorrelated noise, it is shown for a variety of models that the Ito calculus may provide a more useful approximation than the Stratonovich. Important limitations of this result and on the use of SDEs are indicated. These findings and observations are compared with those of several papers in the recent literature. {\textcopyright} 1977.},

abstract = {In spatio-temporal population dynamic models, the most important concept, in addition to mean and variance of local density fluctuations, is the spatial scale of fluctuations in density expressed by studying the spatial autocovariance function. Analytical formulas for this scale in models with local density regulation, dispersal and spatially autocorrelated noise, are rather simple when based on asymptotic theory giving linear models in the limit as the environmental variance approaches zero. The accuracy of these analytical small noise approximations has, however, not been investigated theoretically. Here, we work out improved approximations for the scale as well the spatial autocorrelation function using non-linear logistic local dynamics and going to the next order of approximation with respect to the environmental variance. Generally, it turns out that the asymptotic results are remarkably accurate under moderate fluctuations in density but may be inaccurate for very large fluctuations. For populations with small dispersal capacity, the main error comes from the fact that the logistic dynamics is non-linear, and this error is partly wiped out as dispersal increases. Proportional harvesting has a large effect on the dynamics in spatial as well as non-spatial models, increasing population fluctuations and their spatial scale. The optimal harvesting rate with respect to expected yield per time unit, however, is only to a small extent affected by the magnitude of population fluctuations unless these are very large, so that asymptotic results are applicable over a large range of population fluctuations.},

Between such neighboring areas there will be white noise variation in mean breeding values, while the variation at larger distances has a spatial structure and a spatial scale that we investigate. The model is analyzed by solving balance equations for the stationary distribution of mean breeding values. We also present scaling results for the spatial autocovariance function for mean breeding values as well as that for the covariance between mean breeding value and the optimal phenotype expressing local adaption. Our results show in particular how these spatial scales depend on population density. For large densities the spatial scale of fluctuations in mean breeding values have similarities with corresponding results in population dynamics, where the effect of migration on spatial scales may be large if the local strength of density regulation is small. In our evolutionary model strength of density regulation corresponds to strength of local selection so that weak local selection may produce large spatial scales of autocovariances. Genetic drift and stochastic migration are shown to act through the population size within a characteristic area with much smaller variation in optimal phenotypes than in the whole population.},

abstract = {Mixed models are now well-established methods in ecology and evolution because they allow accounting for and quantifying within-and between-individual variation. However, the required normal distribution of the random effects can often be violated by the presence of clusters among subjects, which leads to multi-modal distributions. In such cases, using what is known as mixture regression models might offer a more appropriate approach. These models are widely used in psychology, sociology, and medicine to describe the diversity of trajectories occurring within a population over time (e.g. psychological development, growth). In ecology and evolution, however, these models are seldom used even though understanding changes in individual trajectories is an active area of research in life-history studies. Our aim is to demonstrate the value of using mixture models to describe variation in individual life-history tactics within a population, and hence to promote the use of these models by ecologists and evolutionary ecologists. We first ran a set of simulations to determine whether and when a mixture model allows teasing apart latent clustering, and to contrast the precision and accuracy of estimates obtained from mixture models versus mixed models under a wide range of ecological contexts. We then used empirical data from long-term studies of large mammals to illustrate the potential of using mixture models for assessing within-population variation in life-history tactics. Mixture models performed well in most cases, except for variables following a Bernoulli distribution and when sample size was small. The four selection criteria we evaluated [Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and two bootstrap methods] performed similarly well, selecting the right number of clusters in most ecological situations. We then showed that the normality of random effects implicitly assumed by evolutionary ecologists when using mixed models was often violated in life-history data. Mixed models were quite robust to this violation in the sense that fixed effects were unbiased at the population level. However, fixed effects at the cluster level and random effects were better estimated using mixture models. Our empirical analyses demonstrated that using mixture models facilitates the identification of the diversity of growth and reproductive tactics occurring within a population. Therefore, using this modelling framework allows testing for the presence of clusters and, when clusters occur, provides reliable estimates of fixed and random effects for each cluster of the population. In the presence or expectation of clusters, using mixture models offers a suitable extension of mixed models, particularly when evolutionary ecologists aim at identifying how ecological and evolutionary processes change within a population. Mixture regression models therefore provide a valuable addition to the statistical toolbox of evolutionary ecologists. As these models are complex and have their own limitations, we provide recommendations to guide future users.},

abstract = {There is large interspecific variation in the magnitude of population fluctuations, even among closely related species. The factors generating this variation are not well understood, primarily because of the challenges of separating the relative impact of variation in population size from fluctuations in the environment. Here, we show using demographic data from 13 bird populations that magnitudes of fluctuations in population size are mainly driven by stochastic fluctuations in the environment. Regulation towards an equilibrium population size occurs through density-dependent mortality. At small population sizes, population dynamics are primarily driven by environment-driven variation in recruitment, whereas close to the carrying capacity K, variation in population growth is more strongly influenced by density- dependent mortality of both juveniles and adults. Our results provide evidence for the hypothesis proposed by Lack that population fluctuations in birds arise from temporal variation in the difference between density-independent recruitment and density-dependent mortality during the non-breeding season.},

abstract = {The Trivers–Willard theory1 proposes that the sex ratio of offspring should vary with maternal condition when it has sex‐specific influences on offspring fitness. In particular, mothers in good condition in polygynous and dimorphic species are predicted to produce an excess of sons, whereas mothers in poor condition should do the opposite. Despite the elegance of the theory, support for it has been limited2, 3. Here we extend and generalize the Trivers–Willard theory to explain the disparity between predictions and observations of offspring sex ratio. In polygynous species, males typically have higher mortality rates4, different age‐specific reproductive schedules and more risk‐prone life history tactics than females; however, these differences are not currently incorporated into the Trivers–Willard theory. Using two‐sex models parameterized with data from free‐living mammal populations with contrasting levels of sex differences in demography, we demonstrate how sex differences in life history traits over the entire lifespan can lead to a wide range of sex allocation tactics, and show that correlations between maternal condition and offspring sex ratio alone are insufficient to conclude that mothers adaptively adjust offspring sex ratio.},

In climates predicted less favourable populations are expected to decline, and in favourable climates they are expected to persist. However, little comparative empirical support exists for a relationship between predicted climate suitability and population performance. We found that the performance of 93 populations of 34 plant species worldwide – as measured by in situ population growth rate, its temporal variation and extinction risk – was not correlated with climate suitability. However, correlations of demographic processes underpinning population performance with climate suitability indicated both resistance and vulnerability pathways of population responses to climate: in less suitable climates, plants experienced greater retrogression (resistance pathway) and greater variability in some demographic rates (vulnerability pathway). While a range of demographic strategies occur within species' climatic niches, demographic strategies are more constrained in climates predicted to be less suitable.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

We ask, what is the relative contribution of transient boom and bust to the dynamic trajectories of plant populations in stochastic environments? Is this contribution patterned by phylogeny, growth form or the number of life stages per population and per species?We show that transients contribute nearly 50{\%} or more to the resulting trajectories, depending on whether transient and stable contributions are partitioned according to their absolute or net contribution to population dynamics.Both transient contributions and asymptotic contributions are influenced heavily by the number of life stages modelled. We discuss whether the drivers of transients should be considered real ecological phenomena, or artefacts of study design and modelling strategy. We find no evidence for phylogenetic signal in the contribution of transients to stochastic growth, nor clear patterns related to growth form. We find a surprising tendency for plant populations to boom rather than bust in response to temporal changes in vital rates and that stochastic growth rates increase with increasing tendency to boom. Synthesis. Transient dynamics contribute significantly to stochastic population dynamics but are often overlooked in ecological and evolutionary studies that employ stochastic analyses. Better understanding of transient responses to fluctuating population structure will yield better management strategies for plant populations, and better grasp of evolutionary dynamics in the real world.},

abstract = {Human evolution depends on the co-evolution between genetically determined behaviors and socially transmitted information. Although vertical transmission of cultural information from parent to offspring is common in hominins, its effects on cumulative cultural evolution are not fully understood. Here, we investigate gene–culture co-evolution in a family-structured population by studying the invasion fitness of a mutant allele that influences a deterministic level of cultural information (e.g., amount of knowledge or skill) to which diploid carriers of the mutant are exposed in subsequent generations. We show that the selection gradient on such a mutant, and the concomitant level of cultural information it generates, can be evaluated analytically under the assumption that the cultural dynamic has a single attractor point, thereby making gene–culture co-evolution in family-structured populations with multigenerational effects mathematically tractable. We apply our result to study how genetically determined phenotypes of individual and social learning co-evolve with the level of adaptive information they generate under vertical transmission. We find that vertical transmission increases adaptive information due to kin selection effects, but when information is transmitted as efficiently between family members as between unrelated individuals, this increase is moderate in diploids. By contrast, we show that the way resource allocation into learning trades off with allocation into reproduction (the “learning-reproduction trade-off”) significantly influences levels of adaptive information. We also show that vertical transmission prevents evolutionary branching and may therefore play a qualitative role in gene–culture co-evolutionary dynamics. More generally, our analysis of selection suggests that vertical transmission can significantly increase levels of adaptive information under the biologically plausible condition that information transmission between relatives is more efficient than between unrelated individuals.},

abstract = {Summary 1. A central question in ecology is to separate the relative contribution of density dependence and stochastic influences to annual fluctuations in population size. Here we estimate the deterministic and stochastic components of the dynamics of different European populations of white stork Ciconia ciconia. We then examined whether annual changes in population size was related to the climate during the breeding period (the 'tap hypothesis'sensu Saether, Sutherland {\&} Engen (2004, Advances in Ecological Research, 35, 185-209) or during the nonbreeding period, especially in the winter areas in Africa (the 'tube hypothesis'). 2. A general characteristic of the population dynamics of this long-distance migrant is small environmental stochasticity and strong density regulation around the carrying capacity with short return times to equilibrium. 3. Annual changes in the size of the eastern European populations were correlated by rainfall in the wintering areas in Africa as well as local weather in the breeding areas just before arrival and in the later part of the breeding season and regional climate variation (North Atlantic Oscillation). This indicates that weather influences the population fluctuations of white storks through losses of sexually mature individuals as well as through an effect on the number of individuals that manages to establish themselves in the breeding population. Thus, both the tap and tube hypothesis explains climate influences on white stork population dynamics. 4. The spatial scale of environmental noise after accounting for the local dynamics was 67 km, suggesting that the strong density dependence reduces the synchronizing effects of climate variation on the population dynamics of white stork. 5. Several climate variables reduced the synchrony of the residual variation in population size after accounting for density dependence and demographic stochasticity, indicating that these climate variables had a synchronizing effect on the population fluctuations. In contrast, other climatic variables acted as desynchronizing agents. 6. Our results illustrate that evaluating the effects of common environmental variables on the spatio-temporal variation in population dynamics require estimates and modelling of their influence on the local dynamics.

abstract = {Density dependence in vital rates is a key feature affecting temporal fluctuations of natural populations. This has important implications for the rate of random genetic drift. Mating systems also greatly affect effective population sizes, but knowledge of how mating system and density regulation interact to affect random genetic drift is poor. Using theoretical models and simulations, we compare Ne in short-lived, density-dependent animal populations with different mating systems. We study the impact of a fluctuating, density-dependent sex ratio and consider both a stable and a fluctuating environment. We find a negative relationship between annual Ne/N and adult population size N due to density dependence, suggesting that loss of genetic variation is reduced at small densities. The magnitude of this decrease was affected by mating system and life history. A male-biased, density-dependent sex ratio reduces the rate of genetic drift compared to an equal, density-independent sex ratio, but a stochastic change towards male bias reduces the Ne/N ratio. Environmental stochasticity amplifies temporal fluctuations in population size and is thus vital to consider in estimation of effective population sizes over longer time periods. Our results on the reduced loss of genetic variation at small densities, particularly in polygamous populations, indicate that density regulation may facilitate adaptive evolution at small population sizes.},

We therefore examine whether such models are necessary to avoid biased estimates of stochastic population growth and extinction risk, by comparing output from a matrix population model that incorporates reproductive autocorrelations to output from a standard age-structured matrix model that does not. We use a range of parameterisations, including a case study using moose data, treating probabilities of switching reproductive class as either fixed or fluctuating.

We include two age classes, juveniles and adults, where juveniles are subject to logistic density dependence. There are environmental stochastic effects with arbitrary spatial scales on all birth and death rates, and individuals of both age classes are subject to density independent dispersal with given rates and specified distributions of dispersal distances. We show how to simulate the joint density fields of the age classes and derive results for the spatial scales of all spatial autocovariance functions for densities. A general result is that the squared scale has an additive term equal to the squared scale of the environmental noise, corresponding to the Moran effect, as well as additive terms proportional to the dispersal rate and variance of dispersal distance for the age classes and approximately inversely proportional to the strength of density regulation. We show that the optimal harvesting strategy in the deterministic case is to harvest only juveniles when their relative value (e.g. financial) is large, and otherwise only adults. With increasing environmental stochasticity there is an interval of increasing length of values of juveniles relative to adults where both age classes should be harvested. Harvesting generally tends to increase all spatial scales of the autocovariances of densities.},

Late-life mortality plateaus have been discovered in a broad variety of taxa, including humans, but their origin is hotly debated. One hypothesis argues that deceleration occurs because the individual probability of death stops increasing at very old ages, predicting the evolution of earlier onset of mortality plateaus under increased rate of extrinsic mortality. By contrast, heterogeneity theory suggests that mortality deceleration arises from individual differences in intrinsic lifelong robustness and predicts that variation in robustness between populations will result in differences in mortality deceleration. We used experimental evolution to directly test these predictions by independently manipulating extrinsic mortality rate (high or low) and mortality source (random death or condition-dependent) to create replicate populations of nematodes, Caenorhabditis remanei that differ in the strength of selection in late-life and in the level of lifelong robustness. Late-life mortality deceleration evolved in response to differences in mortality source when mortality rate was held constant, while there was no consistent response to differences in mortality rate. These results provide direct experimental support for the heterogeneity theory of late-life mortality deceleration.},

abstract = {1. Traditional estimation of age-specific survival and mortality rates in vertebrates is limited to individuals with known age. Although this subject has been studied extensively using effective capture-recapture and capture-recovery models, inference remains challenging because of large numbers of incomplete records (i.e. unknown age of many individuals) and because of the inadequate duration of the studies. 2. Here, we present a hierarchical model for capture-recapture/recovery (CRR) data sets with large proportions of unknown times of birth and death. The model uses a Bayesian framework to draw inference on population-level age-specific demographic rates using parametric survival functions and applies this information to reconstruct times of birth and death for individuals with unknown age. 3. We simulated a set of CRR data sets with varying study span and proportions of individuals with known age, and varying recapture and recovery probabilities. We used these data sets to compare our method to a traditional CRR model, which requires knowledge of individual ages. Subsequently, we applied our method to a subset of a long-term CRR data set on Soay sheep. 4. Our results show that this method performs better than the common CRR model when sample sizes are low. Still, our model is sensitive to the choice of priors with low recapture probability and short studies. In such cases, priors that overestimate survival perform better than those that underestimate it. Also, the model was able to estimate accurately ages at death for Soay sheep, with an average error of 0.94 years and to identify differences in mortality rate between sexes. 5. Although many of the problems in the estimation of age-specific survival can be reduced through more efficient sampling schemes, most ecological data sets are still sparse and with a large proportion of missing records. Thus, improved sampling needs still to be combined with statistical models capable of overcoming the unavoidable limitations of any fieldwork. We show that our approach provides reliable estimates of parameters and unknown times of birth and death even with the most incomplete data sets while being flexible enough to accommodate multiple recapture probabilities and covariates.},

abstract = {This paper is a commentary on the focal article by Grafen and on earlier papers of his on which many of the results of this focal paper depend. Thus it is in effect a commentary on the “formal Darwinian project”, the focus of this sequence of papers. Several problems with this sequence are raised and discussed. The first of these concerns fitness maximization. It is often claimed in these papers that natural selection leads to a maximization of fitness and that this view is claimed in Fisher's “fundamental theorem of natural selection”. These claims are refuted, and various incorrect statements about the meaning and interpretation of the fundamental theorem of natural selection, in this sequence and in other papers by other authors, are discussed. Next, much of the work in this sequence rests on the first Price equation. In the deterministic (infinite population) case this equation is no more than the standard classical equation relating to changes in gene frequencies. In the stochastic case the equation gives the change in gene frequencies as the sum of two terms (the second of which vanishes in the deterministic case). These two terms are of essentially equal importance in the situation considered in the focal article, yet one of Grafen's results ignores the second term in the stochastic analysis. This is associated with a wavering between deterministic and stochastic analyses and the use of the Price fitness concept and the classical fitness concept. These comments cast doubts on Grafen's optimization theory.},

Understanding age-specific survival in wild animal populations is crucial to the study of popula- tion dynamics and is therefore an essential component of several fields including evolution,manage- ment and conservation. 2.

The method copes with low recapture probabilities, unknown ages (e.g. because of left-trunca- tion) and unknown ages at death (e.g. because of right-censoring). It estimates survival and detec- tion parameters as well as the unknown birth and death times (i.e. latent states) while allowing users to test a range of survivalmodels. In addition, the effect of continuous or categorical covariates can be evaluated. 4. This tool facilitates the analysis of age patterns of survival in long-term animal studies and will enable researchers to robustly infer the effect of covariates, even with large amounts of missing data.},

This paper develops a model to describe the dynamics of such a population, classifying individ- uals both by age and size. It is based on a model originally proposed by Goodman (1969) as an extension to the Leslie matrix. The model allows a projection of the transient dynamics of a population from an arbitrary set of starting numbers. It also allows some asymptotic properties of the population to be determined, namely, the finite rate of increase, the stable age/size distribution, and the repro- ductive values. In the special case of reproduction and survival being independent of size, the model reduces to a Leslie matrix. In the special case of reproduction and mortality being independent of age, it yields results which approximate to a form of the stage projection matrix (Lefkovitch matrix). The main results of the model are illustrated with an example based on a plant with a monocarpic life history.},

abstract = {This article presents an extension of the cohort-component model of population projection (CCMPP) first formulated by Heuveline (2003) that is capable of modeling a population affected by HIV. Heuveline proposes a maximum likelihood approach to estimate the age profile of HIV incidence that produced the HIV epidemics in East Africa during the 1990s. We extend this work by developing the Leslie matrix representation of the CCMPP, which greatly facilitates the implementation of the model for parameter estimation and projection. The Leslie matrix also contains information about the stable tendencies of the corresponding population, such as the stable age distribution and time to stability. Another contribution of this work is that we update the sources of data used to estimate the parameters, and use these data to estimate a modified version of the CCMPP that includes (estimated) parameters governing the survival experience of the infected population. A further application of the model to a small population with high HIV prevalence in rural South Africa is presented as an additional demonstration. This work lays the foundation for development of more robust and flexible Bayesian estimation methods that will greatly enhance the utility of this and similar models.},

abstract = {Summary A single species is often modeled as a structured population. In a matrix projection model, individuals in the population are partitioned into a finite number of stage classes. For example, an insect population can be partitioned into egg, larva, pupa and adult stages. For some populations the stages are better described by a continuous variable, such as the stem diameter of a plant. For such populations an integral projection model can be used to describe the population dynamics, and might be easier to use or more accurate than a matrix model. In this article we discuss the similarities and differences between matrix projection models and integral projection models. We illustrate integral projection modeling by a Platte thistle population, showing how the model is determined by basic life history functions.},

abstract = {The attempt to understand the statement, and then to find the interpretation, of Fisher's "Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection" caused problems for generations of population geneticists. Price's (1972) paper was the first to lead to an understanding of the statement of the theorem. The theorem shows (in the discrete-time case) that the so-called "partial change" in mean fitness of a population between a parental generation and an offspring generation is the parental generation additive genetic variance in fitness divided by the parental generation mean fitness. In the continuous-time case the partial rate of change in mean fitness is equal to the parental generation additive genetic variance in fitness with no division by the mean fitness. This "partial change" has been interpreted by some as the change in mean fitness due to changes in gene frequency, and by others as the change in mean fitness due to natural selection. (Fisher variously used both interpretations.) In this paper we discuss these interpretations of the theorem. We indicate why we are unhappy with both. We also discuss the long-term relevance of the Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, again reaching a negative assessment. We introduce and discuss the concept of genic evolutionary potential. We finally review an optimizing theorem that involves changes in gene frequency, the additive genetic variance in fitness and the mean fitness itself, all of which are involved in the Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, and which is free of the difficulties in interpretation of the Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection.},

abstract = {abstract: Evolutionary biology is undergirded by an extensive and impressive set of mathematical models. Yet only one result, Fisher's theorem about selection and fitness, is generally accorded the status of a fundamental theorem. I argue that although its fundamental sta-tus is justified by its simplicity and scope, there are additional results that seem similarly fundamental. I suggest that the most fundamental theorem of evolution is the Price equation, both because of its simplic-ity and broad scope and because it can be used to derive four other fa-miliar results that are similarly fundamental: Fisher's average-excess equation, Robertson's secondary theorem of natural selection, the breeder's equation, and Fisher's fundamental theorem. These derivations clarify both the relationships behind these results and their assumptions. Slightly less fundamental results include those for multivariate evolution and social selection. A key feature of fundamental theorems is that they have great simplicity and scope, which are often achieved by sacrificing per-fect accuracy. Quantitative genetics has been more productive of fun-damental theorems than population genetics, probably because its em-pirical focus on unknown genotypes freed it from the tyranny of detail and allowed it to focus on general issues. Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection states that natural selection increases the mean fitness at a rate equal to the additive genetic variance for fitness (Fisher 1930). The name he bestowed on it makes it clear that he viewed it as a very important result, as does his likening it to the second law of thermodynamics. Opinions about it have waxed and waned over the years or, more accurately, waned and waxed, with ini-tially negative views (Kempthorne 1957; Li 1967; Crow and Kimura 1970; Karlin 1975; Nagylaki 1991) being supplanted by more favorable ones (Ewens},

abstract = {Historical events have been used to explain a wide range of phenomena including geographical distributions of species, community diversity, and population structure. At the level of individuals, historical effects in which past conditions influence future performance are particularly likely to occur in long-lived organisms that store resources between seasons and that form organs months or years before their elaboration. Such carryover mechanisms have been documented in several perennial plant species, but the implications for population processes are poorly known. In this study, I examine how the history of individuals influences their future performance, population dynamics, and life cycle structure in the long-lived herb Lathyrus vernus. Overall effects of plant history on population dynamics, in terms of growth rate, reproductive values, stable stage distribution, and elasticities, are examined by comparing an ordinary first-order matrix model with a second-order matrix model. In the latter, not only the present state of individuals, but also their past state is allowed to influence future fate. The results demonstrate that the history of individuals is sometimes important in models of population dynamics. Plant size change over a one-year period was negatively correlated among time intervals. Addition of the previous year's stage in population models shifted the growth rate from positive (l 5 1.010) to negative (l 5 0.986) and increased the proportion of small established individuals in the stable stage distribution. If historical effects are due to a capacity to buffer environmental variation and regain size or state, as in L. vernus, then recruitment contributes less and stasis more to population growth than suggested by ahistorical models. The presence of historical effects at the level of individuals, in any form, may have important consequences for population development and should be included in any interpretation of the life-cycle structure.},

abstract = {The "two-sex problem" is one of attempting to preserve the essential character of male and female rates of marriage (or birth), since the expression of those rates is influenced both by the age-sex composition of the population and the underlying age-sex schedule of preferences. The present paper focuses on marriage and advances a theoretically based, realistic, and conceptually simple solution. In the continuous case, where exact male and female ages are used, equation (11) provides a mathematical relationship which equates the sum of the male and female marriage propensities of the observed population with that of the model. When discrete age intervals are used, the two-sex consistency condition is given by equation (14) which equates observed and model population rates calculated using the harmonic means of the number of persons in the relevant male and female age groups. The harmonic mean consistency condition is shown to be fully sensitive to the competitive nature of the "marriage market." When compared with alternative approaches to the two-sex problem in the context of data for Sweden, 1961-64, the simple harmonic mean method yields results fairly similar to those of the other methods. None of the two-sex methods do particularly well at predicting the actual distribution of marriages, however. The likely reason is that the underlying marriage preferences changed, a circumstance which emphasizes the importance of carefully conceptualizing how observed behavior can be decomposed into the effects produced by age-sex composition and those produced by the underlying preferences.},

The ranking of a species on the slow-fast continuum – the covariation among life-history traits describing species-specific life cycles along a gradient going from a long life, slow maturity, and low annual reproductive output, to a short life, fast maturity, and high annual reproductive output – strongly correlates with the relative fitness impact of a given amount of variation in adult survival. Under the canalization hypothesis, long- lived species are thus expected to display less individual heterogeneity in survival at the onset of adulthood, when reproductive values peak, than short-lived species.We tested this life-history prediction by analysing long-term time series of individual-based data in nine species of birds and mammals using capture-recapture models. We found that individual heterogeneity in survival was higher in species with short-generation time ({\textless} 3 years) than in species with long generation time ({\textgreater} 4 years).

abstract = {Demographic rates can vary not only with measured individual characters like age, sex and mass but also with unmeasured individual variables like behaviour, genes and health. Predictions from population models that include measured individual characteristics often differ from models that exclude them. Similarly, unmeasured individual differences have the potential to impact predictions from population models. However, unmeasured individual differences are rarely included in population models. We construct stage- and age-structured models (where stage is mass) of a roe deer population, which are parameterized from statistical functions that either include, or ignore, unmeasured individual differences. We found that mass and age structures substantially impacted model parameters describing population dynamics, as did temporal environmental variation, while unmeasured individual differences impacted parameters describing population dynamics to a much smaller extent once individual heterogeneity related to mass and age has been included in the model. We discuss how our assumptions (unmeasured individual differences only in mean trait values) could have influenced our findings and under what circumstances unmeasured individual differences could have had a larger impact on population dynamics. There are two reasons explaining the relative small influence of unmeasured individual differences on population dynamics in roe deer. First, individual body mass and age both capture a large amount of individual differences in roe deer. Second, in large populations of long-lived animals, the average quality of individuals (independent of age and mass) within the population is unlikely to show substantial variation over time, unless rapid evolution is occurring. So even though a population consisting of high-quality individuals would have much higher population growth rate than a population consisting of low-quality individuals, the probability of observing a population consisting only of high-quality individuals is small.},

These structures can give rise to complex population dynamics and interact with environmental conditions. Here we present a model for continuously structured populations with finite size, including both demographic and environmental stochasticity in the dynamics. Using recent methods developed for discrete age-structured models we derive the demographic and environmental variance of the population growth as functions of a continuous state variable. These two parameters, together with the expected population growth rate, are used to define a one-dimensional diffusion approximation of the population dynamics. Thus, a substantial reduction in complexity is achieved as the dynamics of the complex structured model can be described by only three population parameters. We provide methods for numerical calculation of the model parameters and demonstrate the accuracy of the diffusion approximation by computer simulation of specific examples. The general modeling framework makes it possible to analyze and predict future dynamics and extinction risk of populations with various types of structure, and to explore consequences of changes in demography caused by, e.g., climate change or different management decisions. Our results are especially relevant for small populations that are often of conservation concern.},

abstract = {Population viability analysis (PVA) is a technique that employs stochastic demographic models to predict extinction risk. All else being equal, higher variance in a demographic rate leads to a greater extinc-tion risk. Demographic stochasticity represents variance due to differences among individuals. Current imple-mentations of PVAs, however, assume that the expected fates of all individuals are identical. For example, de-mographic stochasticity in survival is modeled as a random draw from a binomial distribution. We developed a simple conceptual model showing that if there is variation among individuals in expected sur-vival, then existing PVA models overestimate the variance due to demographic stochasticity in survival. This is a consequence of Jensen's inequality and the fact that the binomial demographic variance is a concave function of mean survival. The effect of variation among individuals on demographic stochasticity in fecun-dity depends on the mean-variance relationship for individual reproductive success, which is not presently known. If fecundity patterns mirror those of survival, then variation among individuals will reduce the ex-tinction risk of small populations.

abstract = {Keywords aging, dietary restriction, disposable soma, evolution, hyperfunction, insulin/IGF-1 signaling, oxidative damage, target of rapamycin (TOR) Abstract Discovering the biological basis of aging is one of the greatest remaining challenges for science. Work on the biology of aging has discovered a range of interventions and pathways that control aging rate. A picture is emerging of a signaling network that is sensitive to nutritional status and that controls growth, stress resistance, and aging. This network includes the insulin/IGF-1 and target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways and likely mediates the effects of dietary restriction on aging. Yet the biological processes upon which these pathways act to control life span remain unclear. A long-standing guiding assumption about aging is that it is caused by wear and tear, particularly dam-age at the molecular level. One view is that reactive oxygen species (ROS), including free radicals, generated as by-products of cellular metabolism, are a major contributor to this damage. Yet many recent tests of the oxidative damage theory have come up negative. Such tests have opened an exciting new phase in biogerontology in which fundamental assumptions about ag-ing are being reexamined and revolutionary concepts are emerging. Among these concepts is the hyperfunction theory, which postulates that processes contributing to growth and reproduction run on in later life, leading to hypertrophic and hyperplastic pathologies. Here we reexamine central con-cepts about the nature of aging.},

abstract = {AbstractTheoretical work has emphasized the important role of individual traits on population dynamics, but empirical models are often based on average or stage-dependent demographic rates. In this study on a monogamous bird, the Eurasian hoopoe (Upupa epops), we show how the interactions between male and female fixed and dynamic heterogeneity influence demographic rates and population dynamics. We built an integral projection model including individual sex, age, condition (reflecting dynamic heterogeneity), and fixed morphology (reflecting fixed heterogeneity). Fixed morphology was derived from a principal component analysis of six morphological traits. Our results revealed that reproductive success and survival were linked to fixed heterogeneity, whereas dynamic heterogeneity influenced mainly the timing of reproduction. Fixed heterogeneity had major consequences for the population growth rate, but interestingly, its effect on population dynamics differed between the sexes. Female fixed morphology was directly linked to annual reproductive success, whereas male fixed morphology also influenced annual survival, being twice higher in large than in small males. Even in a monogamous bird with shared parental care, large males can reach 10{\%} higher fitness than females. Including the dynamics of male and female individual traits in population models refines our understanding of the individual mechanisms that influence demographic rates and population dynamics and can help in identifying differences in sex-specific strategies.},

Having been used to study the dynamics of forests all over the world, the Matrix model is thriving in forestry, with applications covering a wide array of areas. Despite its extensive application in forestry, the Matrix model is still suffering from a lack of due attention and appropriate understanding, especially on its advantages and limitations in comparison with those of other forest dynamics models. To facilitate further research and applications, a synthetic review of Matrix models is provided here with an emphasis on its mathematical properties and relationship with other forest dynamics models. In this article, we first introduce the general structure of Matrix models and its representation of forest dynamics components, i.e., upgrowth, mortality, and recruitment. Then, we summarize key properties of Matrix models, including basic assumptions, density dependence, size class width and time step, and the estimation of forest dynamics components will be summarized. Next, we evaluate advantages and limitations of the Matrix model and its relationship with other forest dynamics models. Finally, we share our perspective on the major challenges and future outlooks of Matrix models.},

abstract = {Understanding the role of consumers in plant population dynamics is important, both conceptually and practically. Yet, while the negative effects of herbivory on plant performance have been well documented, we know much less about how individual-level damage translates to impacts on population growth or whether spatial variation in herbivory affects patterns of plant distribution. We studied the role of insect herbivory in the dynamics and distribution of the tree cholla cactus (Opuntia imbricata), a long-lived perennial plant, across an elevational gradient in central New Mexico, USA, from low-elevation grassland (1670 m) to a grassland-mountain transition zone (1720 m) to the rocky slopes of the Los Pinos Mountains (1790 m). Tree cholla density increased significantly with elevation, while abundance of and damage by a suite of native, cactus-feeding insects decreased. We combined field experiments and demographic models to test the hypothesis that systematic spatial variation in chronic insect herbivory limits the tree cholla distribution to a subset of suitable habitat across the gradient. Our results support this hypothesis. We found that key demographic functions (survival, growth, fecundity) and the responses of these functions to experimental reductions in insect herbivory varied across the gradient. The effects of insect exclusion on plant growth and seed production were strongest in the low-elevation grassland and decreased in magnitude with increasing elevation. We used the experimental data to parameterize integral projection models (IPM), which predict the asymptotic rate of population increase (lambda). The modeling results showed that insect herbivory depressed lambda and that the magnitude of this effect was context-dependent. The effect of insect herbivory on population growth was strongest at low elevation (Delta lambda(low) = 0.095), intermediate at mid elevation (Delta lambda(mid) = 0.046), and weakest at high elevation (Delta lambda(high) = -0.0089). The total effect of insects on lambda was due to a combination of reductions in growth and in fecundity and their combination; the relative contribution of each of these effects varied spatially. Our results, generated by experimental demography across a heterogeneous landscape, provide new insights into the role of native consumers in the population dynamics and distribution of abundance of long-lived native plants.},

Here, we develop parameterized integral projection models of size-related flowering for the monocarpic perennial Oenothera glazioviana and use these to predict the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for flowering. For the most part there is excellent agreement between the model predictions and the results of quantitative field studies. However, the model predicts a much steeper relationship between plant size and the probability of flowering than observed in the field, indicating selection for a 'threshold size' flowering function. Elasticity and sensitivity analysis of population growth rate lambda and net reproductive rate R(0) are used to identify the critical traits that determine fitness and control the ESS for flowering. Using the fitted model we calculate the fitness landscape for invading genotypes and show that this is characterized by a ridge of approximately equal fitness. The implications of these results for the maintenance of genetic variation are discussed.},

Here we combine recently developed population modeling approaches and theory in stochastic demography to explore how life history, morphology, and average fitness respond to changes in the frequency of favorable environmental conditions and in the color of environmental noise in a model organism (an acarid mite). We predict that different life-history variables respond correlatively to changes in the environment, and we identify different life-history variables, including lifetime reproductive success, as indicators of average fitness and life-history speed across stochastic environments. Depending on the shape of adult survival rate, generation time can be used as an indicator of the response of populations to stochastic change, as in the deterministic case. This work is a useful step toward understanding population dynamics in stochastic environments, including how stochastic change may shape the evolution of life histories.},

abstract = {The timing of birth has marked impacts on early life and early development of newborns in many species. Early-born offspring often survive and grow better than late-born offspring, but despite the long-lasting effects of early conditions on life history traits, the influence of birth date on fitness has rarely been investigated for long-lived species. In this study, we analyzed both the short- and long-term effects of birth date on individual life history traits and explored its subsequent impact on individual fitness in a population of roe deer. We considered both the direct effects, as well as the indirect effects of birth date mediated through the effects of body mass, on demographic parameters. We found that in addition to short-term effects on early body growth and survival, birth date generates ``silver spoon' effects on adult life history traits of female roe deer. Birth date had long-lasting effects on female adult body mass such that early-born females were, on average, 3{\~{}}kg heavier as adults than late-born females, although female adult survival was similar between these categories. Based on the observed relationships between birth date, body mass and demographic parameters, we built an integral projection model describing the simultaneous distributions of birth date and body mass to quantify the fitness consequences of birth date. We found that the fitness of early-born females was higher than that of late-born females. These long-lasting effects of birth date on fitness were mostly mediated through the influence of birth date on recruitment and adult body mass. By determining development of newborns during the early stages of life, birth date has a critical influence on each step of an individual's subsequent life history trajectory.},

Following a suggestion of Fisher, we show that weighting individuals of different age by their reproductive value serves as a filter, removing temporal autocorrelation in population demography and evolution due to stochastic age structure. Assuming weak selection, random mating, and a stationary distribution of environments with no autocorrelation, we derive a diffusion approximation for evolution of the reproductive value weighted allele frequency. The expected evolution obeys an adaptive topography defined by the long-run growth rate of the population. The expected fitness of a genotype is its Malthusian fitness in the average environment minus the covariance of its growth rate with that of the population. Simulations of the age-structured model verify the accuracy of the diffusion approximation. We develop statistical methods for measuring the expected selection on the reproductive value weighted allele frequency in a fluctuating age-structured population.},

abstract = {Understanding the processes behind change in reproductive state along life-history trajectories is a salient research program in evolutionary ecology. Two processes, state dependence and heterogeneity, can drive the dynamics of change among states. Both processes can operate simultaneously, begging the difficult question of how to tease them apart in practice. The Neutral Theory for Life Histories (NTLH) holds that the bulk of variations in life-history trajectories is due to state dependence and is hence neutral: Once previous (breeding) state is taken into account, variations are mostly random. Lifetime reproductive success (LRS), the number of descendants produced over an individual's reproductive life span, has been used to infer support for NTLH in natura. Support stemmed from accurate prediction of the population-level distribution of LRS with parameters estimated from a state dependence model. We show with Monte Carlo simulations that the current reliance of NTLH on LRS prediction in a null hypothesis framework easily leads to selecting a misspecified model, biased estimates and flawed inferences. Support for the NTLH can be spurious because of a systematic positive bias in estimated state dependence when heterogeneity is present in the data but ignored in the analysis. This bias can lead to spurious positive covariance between fitness components when there is in fact an underlying trade-off. Furthermore, neutrality implied by NTLH needs a clarification because of a probable disjunction between its common understanding by evolutionary ecologists and its translation into statistical models of life-history trajectories. Irrespective of what neutrality entails, testing hypotheses about the dynamics of change among states in life histories requires a multimodel framework because state dependence and heterogeneity can easily be mistaken for each other.},

Their relative magnitude is crucial for evolutionary pro- cesses, as only the former may allow for adaptation. However, the importance of fixed heterogeneity in small populations has recently been questioned. Using neutral simulations (NS), several studies failed to detect fixed heterogeneity, thus challenging previous results from mixed models (MM). To understand the causes of this discrep- ancy, we estimate the statistical power and false positive rate of both methods and apply them to empirical data from a wild rodent pop- ulation. While MM show high false-positive rates if confounding factors are not accounted for, they have high statistical power to de- tect real fixed heterogeneity. In contrast, NS are also subject to high false-positive rates but always have low power. Indeed, MM analyses of the rodent population data show significant fixed heterogeneity in reproductive success, whereas NS analyses do not. We suggest that fixedheterogeneity maybemorecommonthanis suggested by NS and that NS are useful only if more powerful methods are not appli- cable and if they are complemented by a power analysis.},

abstract = {Populations can show temporal autocorrelation in the dynamics arising from different mechanisms, including fluctuations in the demographic structure. This autocorrelation is often treated as a complicating factor in the analyses of stochastic population growth and extinction risk. However, it also reflects important information about the demographic structure. Here, we consider how temporal autocorrelation is related to demographic stochasticity in structured populations. Demographic stochasticity arises from inherent randomness in the demographic processes of individuals, like survival and reproduction, and the resulting impact on population growth is measured by the demographic variance. Earlier studies have shown that population structure have positive or negative effects on the demographic variance compared to a model where the structure is ignored. Here, we derive a new expression for the demographic variance of a structured population, using the temporal autocorrelation function of the population growth rate. We show that the relative difference in demographic variance when the structure is included or ignored (the effect of structure on demographic variance) is approximately twice the sum of the autocorrelations. We demonstrate the result for a simple hypothetical example, as well as a set of empirical examples using age-structured models of 24 mammals from the demographic database COMADRE. In the empirical examples, the sum of the autocorrelation function was negative in all cases, indicating that age structure generally has a negative effect on the demographic variance (i.e. the demographic variance is lower compared to that of a model where the structure is ignored). Other kinds of structure, such as spatial heterogeneity affecting fecundity, can have positive effects on the demographic variance, and the sum of the autocorrelations will then be positive. These results yield new insights into the complex interplay between population structure, demographic variance, and temporal autocorrelation, that shapes the population dynamics and extinction risk of populations.},

abstract = {Integral projection models (IPMs) are extremely flexible tools for ecological and evolutionary inference. IPMs track the distribution of phenotype in populations through time, using functions describing phenotype-dependent development, inheritance, survival and fecundity. For evolutionary inference, two important features of any model are the ability to (i) characterize relationships among traits (including values of the same traits across ages) within individuals, and (ii) characterize similarity between individuals and their descendants. In IPM analyses, the former depends on regressions of observed trait values at each age on values at the previous age (development functions), and the latter on regressions of offspring values at birth on parent values as adults (inheritance functions). We show analytically that development functions, characterized this way, will typically underestimate covariances of trait values across ages, due to compounding of regression to the mean across projection steps. Similarly, we show that inheritance, characterized this way, is inconsistent with a modern understanding of inheritance, and underestimates the degree to which relatives are phenotypically similar. Additionally, we show that the use of a constant biometric inheritance function, particularly with a constant intercept, is incompatible with evolution. Consequently, current implementations of IPMs will predict little or no phenotypic evolution, purely as artefacts of their construction. We present alternative approaches to constructing development and inheritance functions, based on a quantitative genetic approach, and show analytically and through an empirical example on a population of bighorn sheep how they can potentially recover patterns that are critical to evolutionary inference.},

abstract = {Splitting trees are those random trees where individuals give birth at constant rate during a lifetime with general distribution, to i.i.d. copies of themselves. The width process of a splitting tree is then a binary, homogeneous Crump--Mode--Jagers (CMJ) process, and is not Markovian unless the lifetime distribution is exponential. Here, we allow the birth rate to be infinite, that is, pairs of birth times and lifespans of newborns form a Poisson point process along the lifetime of their mother, with possibly infinite intensity measure. A splitting tree is a random (so-called) chronological tree. Each element of a chronological tree is a (so-called) existence point {\$}(v,\backslashtau){\$} of some individual {\$}v{\$} (vertex) in a discrete tree, where {\$}\backslashtau{\$} is a nonnegative real number called chronological level (time). We introduce a total order on existence points, called linear order, and a mapping {\$}\backslashvarphi{\$} from the tree into the real line which preserves this order. The inverse of {\$}\backslashvarphi{\$} is called the exploration process, and the projection of this inverse on chronological levels the contour process. For splitting trees truncated up to level {\$}\backslashtau{\$}, we prove that thus defined contour process is a L$\backslash$'evy process reflected below {\$}\backslashtau{\$} and killed upon hitting 0. This allows to derive properties of (i) splitting trees: conceptual proof of Le Gall--Le Jan's theorem in the finite variation case, exceptional points, coalescent point process, age distribution; (ii) CMJ processes: one-dimensional marginals, conditionings, limit theorems, asymptotic numbers of individuals with infinite vs finite descendances.},

abstract = {Stage-structured models that integrate demography and dispersal can be used to identify points in the life cycle with large effects on rates of population spatial spread, information that is vital in the development of containment strategies for invasive species. Current challenges in the application of these tools include: (1) accounting for large uncertainty in model parameters, which may violate assumptions of "local" perturbation metrics such as sensitivities and elasticities, and (2) forecasting not only asymptotic rates of spatial spread, as is usually done, but also transient spatial dynamics in the early stages of invasion. We developed an invasion model for the Diaprepes root weevil (DRW; Diaprepes abbreviatus [Coleoptera: Curculionidae]), a generalist herbivore that has invaded citrus-growing regions of the United States. We synthesized data on DRW demography and dispersal and generated predictions for asymptotic and transient peak invasion speeds, accounting for parameter uncertainty. We quantified the contributions of each parameter toward invasion speed using a "global" perturbation analysis, and we contrasted parameter contributions during the transient and asymptotic phases. We found that the asymptotic invasion speed was 0.02-0.028 km/week, although the transient peak invasion speed (0.03-0.045 km/week) was significantly greater. Both asymptotic and transient invasions speeds were most responsive to weevil dispersal distances. However, demographic parameters that had large effects on asymptotic speed (e.g., survival of early-instar larvae) had little effect on transient speed. Comparison of the global analysis with lower-level elasticities indicated that local perturbation analysis would have generated unreliable predictions for the responsiveness of invasion speed to underlying parameters. Observed range expansion in southern Florida (1992-2006) was significantly lower than the invasion speed predicted by the model. Possible causes of this mismatch include overestimation of dispersal distances, demographic rates, and spatiotemporal variation in parameter values. This study demonstrates that, when parameter uncertainty is large, as is often the case, global perturbation analyses are needed to identify which points in the life cycle should be targets of management. Our results also suggest that effective strategies for reducing spread during the asymptotic phase may have little effect during the transient phase.},

RESULTS We start with the general case, in which we do not assume any structure of the underlying baseline hazard, the frailty distribution, or their link to one another.

The evaluation of alternative population management interventions may be particularly vulnerable to error if the degree of nonlinearity depends on the element of the PPM that is targeted. The second self-derivative and the self-sensitivity of elasticity can be used to estimate the degree and sign of nonlinearity in sensitivity and elasticity analyses, respectively. Using simulated matrices, we demonstrate that the magnitude and sign of the second self-derivative and the self-sensitivity of elasticity vary systematically, according to the element of the PPM subject to perturbation.

abstract = {In matrix population models, the process of population “projection” through a number of time steps is fundamentally multiplicative, hence the arithmetic mean of the consecutive matrices is of doubtful meaning, while the geometric mean quite corresponds to the multiplication principle. The geometric mean of positive numbers does not bear any problem, but that of matrices does. The “population projection matrices” (PPMs) are rather nonnegative than positive, with the allocation of non-zeros that is predetermined by the life cycle graph (LCG) reflecting the development biology of a given species, and this graph is principally incomplete. The average matrix A should logically have the same fixed pattern of zeros as those to be averaged, and this causes the averaging matrix equation to be overdetermined as a system of element-wise algebraic equations for the unknown positive elements. Therefore, the exact solution to the problem of pattern-geometric averaging does generally not exist, while the classical (least-squares) approximation leads to a significant error. My heuristic approach to finding a better approximate A for the PPMs in the form of L = T(transition) + F(fertility) is to solve the problem in a combined way: the pattern-geometric approximation for the T part and the exact arithmetic mean for F (as population recruitment is an additive process). As a result, the approximation error decreases drastically due to matrix T being always substochastic, while the combined, TF-averaging, method turns out efficient even under ‘reproductive uncertainty' in data, i.e., for the whole families of feasible matrices F in the sum L = T + {\{}F{\}}. I illustrate the method of TF-averaging with 5 matrices L(t) calibrated for each pair of consecutive years from a 6-year period of observation in a case study of Eritrichium caucasicum, a short-lived perennial herbaceous species. The approximate TF-average enables gaining the ‘age-specific traits from stage-specific models' (Caswell, 2001, p. 116) that are characteristic of the entire period, and I discuss other motivations/advantages for/of pattern-geometric means in matrix population models.},

abstract = {Some secondary sexual traits (SSTs) such as structural characteristics are semi-permanent or static, while others, such as court-ship display, are more labile or dynamic. In this paper we report results from two experiments designed to test the relative attractiveness to female dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis, Passeriformes, Aves) of a relatively static plumage trait, the amount of white in the tail, and a relatively dynamic behavioral trait, courtship intensity. The experiments derived from a study showing that female juncos prefer males that court more vigorously. We asked whether females also base their preferences on plumage traits and how they respond when presented with a choice between attractive traits that are either static (plumage) or dynamic (courtship) in nature. In the first experiment we presented males to females in paired mate-choice trials and found that males enhanced with more white in their tails were more attractive to females than controls with unenhanced tails. Females spent more time with enhanced males and directed more sexual displays toward them. In the second experiment we tested whether females preferred males with enhanced tails (a static SST) or males with enhanced hormone-mediated courtship behavior (a dynamic SST). In this experiment females did not demonstrate a consensus preference for either the static or the dynamic trait. Instead, some females preferred the male whose courtship performance was enhanced with testosterone, while others preferred the male with an enhanced tail. We conclude that both kinds of traits are important in junco mate choice, but that some females apparently weigh static traits more heavily than dynamic ones, while other females use opposite weightings.},

Because reproduction is shaped by the entire life cycle, sex ratio theory would benefit from explicitly two-sex models that include some form of life cycle structure. We present a demographic approach to sex ratio evolution that combines adaptive dynamics with nonlinear matrix population models. We also determine the evolutionary and convergence stability of singular strategies using matrix calculus. These methods allow the incorporation of any population structure, including multiple sexes and stages, into evolutionary projections. Using this framework, we compare how four different interpretations of sex-biased offspring costs affect sex ratio evolution. We find that demographic differences affect evolutionary outcomes and that, contrary to prior belief, sex-biased mortality after parental investment can bias the primary sex ratio (but not the corresponding reproductive value ratio). These results differ qualitatively from the widely held conclusions of previous models that neglect demographic structure.},

abstract = {Most population dynamics models explicitly track the density of a single sex. When the operational sex ratio can vary, two-sex models may be needed to understand and predict population trajectories. Various functions have been proposed to describe the relative contributions of females and males to recruitment, and these functions can differ qualitatively in the patterns that they generate. Which mating function best describes the dynamics of real populations is not known, since alternative two-sex models have not been confronted with experimental data. We conducted the first such comparison, using laboratory populations of the bean beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. Manipulations of the operational sex ratio and total density provided strong support for a demographic model in which the birth rate was proportional to the harmonic mean of female and male densities, and females, males, and their offspring made unique contributions to density dependence. We offer guidelines for transferring this approach to other, less tractable systems in which possibilities for sex ratio manipulations are more limited. We show that informative experimental designs require strong perturbations of the operational sex ratio. The functional form of density dependence (saturating vs. over-compensatory) and the relative contributions of each sex to density dependence can both determine in which direction and at which population densities such perturbations would be most informative. Our experimental results and guidelines for design strategies promote synthesis of two-sex population dynamics theory with empirical data.},

It will be useful for the sake of translation as well as for that of clarity, to delineate the various situations in which geneticists are led to refer to "inbreeding.".

Demographic approaches can be used to improve our understanding of the dynamics of spatially structured populations and help identify subpopulations critical for the long-term persistence of regional metapopulations. We provide a regional metapopulation analysis to inform conservation management for Masai giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) in five subpopulations defined by land management designations. We used data from an individual-based mark–recapture study to estimate subpopulation sizes, subpopulation growth rates, and movement probabilities among subpopulations. We assessed the source–sink structure of the study population by calculating source–sink statistics, and we created a female-based matrix metapopulation model composed of all subpopulations to examine how variation in demographic components of survival, reproduction, and movement affected metapopulation growth rate. Movement data indicated no subpopulation was completely isolated, but movement probabilities varied among subpopulations. Source–sink statistics and net flow of individuals indicated three subpopulations were sources, while two subpopulations were sinks. We found areas with higher wildlife protection efforts and fewer anthropogenic impacts were sources, and less-protected areas were identified as sinks. Our results highlight the importance of identifying source–sink dynamics among subpopulations for effective conservation planning and emphasize how protected areas can play an important role in sustaining metapopulations.},

Although such individual variation in reproductive outcomes has been reported in numerous studies, most analyses to date have not considered whether these realized differences were due to latent individual heterogeneity in reproduction or merely random chance causing different outcomes among like individuals. Furthermore, latent heterogeneity in fitness components might be expressed differently in contrasted environmental conditions, an issue that has only rarely been investigated. Here, we assessed (i) the potential existence of latent individual heterogeneity and (ii) the nature of its expression (fixed vs. variable) in a population of female Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii), using a hierarchical modeling approach on a 30-year mark–recapture data set consisting of 954 individual encounter histories. We found strong support for the existence of latent individual heterogeneity in the population, with “robust” individuals expected to produce twice as many pups as “frail” individuals. Moreover, the expression of individual heterogeneity appeared consistent, with only mild evidence that it might be amplified when environmental conditions are severe. Finally, the explicit modeling of individual heterogeneity allowed us to detect a substantial cost of reproduction that was not evidenced when the heterogeneity was ignored.},

abstract = {Dormant life stages are often critical for population viability in stochastic environments, but accurate field data characterizing them are difficult to collect. Such limitations may translate into uncertainties in demographic parameters describing these stages, which then may propagate errors in the examination of population-level responses to environmental variation. Expanding on current methods, we 1) apply data-driven approaches to estimate parameter uncertainty in vital rates of dormant life stages and 2) test whether such estimates provide more robust inferences about population dynamics. We built integral projection models (IPMs) for a fire-adapted, carnivorous plant species using a Bayesian framework to estimate uncertainty in parameters of three vital rates of dormant seeds – seed-bank ingression, stasis and egression. We used stochastic population projections and elasticity analyses to quantify the relative sensitivity of the stochastic population growth rate (log $\lambda$s) to changes in these vital rates at different fire return intervals. We then ran stochastic projections of log $\lambda$s for 1000 posterior samples of the three seed-bank vital rates and assessed how strongly their parameter uncertainty propagated into uncertainty in estimates of log $\lambda$s and the probability of quasi-extinction, Pq(t). Elasticity analyses indicated that changes in seed-bank stasis and egression had large effects on log $\lambda$s across fire return intervals. In turn, uncertainty in the estimates of these two vital rates explained {\textgreater} 50{\%} of the variation in log $\lambda$s estimates at several fire-return intervals. Inferences about population viability became less certain as the time between fires widened, with estimates of Pq(t) potentially {\textgreater} 20{\%} higher when considering parameter uncertainty. Our results suggest that, for species with dormant stages, where data is often limited, failing to account for parameter uncertainty in population models may result in incorrect interpretations of population viability.},

Populations are constituted by individuals with different phenotypes and thus different performances. However, many models of population dynamics provide no understanding of the influence of this phenotypic variation on population dynamics. In this paper, we investigate how the relationships between demographic rates and phenotype distribution influence the transmission and the upholding of phenotypic variation, and population dynamics. We used integral projection models to measure associations between differences of phenotypic trait (size or mass) among individuals and demographic rates, growth and inheritance, and then quantify the influence of phenotypic variation on population dynamics. We build an analytical and general model resulting from simplifications assuming small phenotypic variance. We illustrate our model with two case studies: a short- and a long-lived life history. Population growth rate r is determined by a Lotka style equation in which survival and fertility are averaged over a phenotypic distribution that changes with age. Here, we further decomposed r to show how much it is affected by shifts in phenotypic average as well as variance. We derived the elasticities of r to the first and second derivative of each demographic rate. In particular, we show that the nonlinearity of change in selective pressure with phenotype matters more to population dynamics than the strength of this selection. In other words, the variance of a given trait will be most important when the strength of selection increases (or decreases) nonlinearly with that trait. Inheritance shapes the distribution of newborn phenotypes. Even if newborns have a fixed average phenotype, the variance among newborns increases with phenotypic variance among mothers, strength of inheritance and developmental variation. We explain how the components of inheritance can influence phenotypic variance and thus the demographic rates and population dynamics. In particular, when mothers of different ages produce offspring of different mean phenotype, the inheritance function can have a large influence on both the mean and variance of the trait at different ages and thus on the population growth rate. We provide new tools to understand how phenotypic variation influences population dynamics and discuss in which life histories we expect this influence to be large. For instance, in our short-lived life history, individual variability has larger effect than in our long-lived life history. We conclude by indicating future directions of analysis.},

abstract = {Reproduction requires resources that cannot be allocated to other functions resulting in direct reproductive costs (i.e. trade-offs between current repro- duction and subsequent survival/reproduction). In wild vertebrates, direct reproductive costs have been widely described in females, but their occurrence in males remains to be explored. To fill this gap, we gathered 53 studies on 48 species testing direct reproductive costs in male vertebrates. We found a trade-off between current reproduction and subsequent performances in 29{\%} of the species and in every clade. As 73{\%} of the studied species are birds, we focused on that clade to investigate whether such trade-offs are associated with (i) levels of paternal care, (ii) polygyny or (iii) pace of life. More precisely for this third question, it is expected that fast species (i.e. short lifespan, early maturity, high fecundity) pay a cost in terms of survival, whereas slow species (with opposite characteristics) do so in terms of fecundity. Our findings tend to support this hypothesis. Finally, we pointed out the potential confounding effects that should be accounted for when investigating reproductive costs in males and strongly encourage the investigation of such costs in more clades to understand to what extent our results are relevant for other vertebrates.},

abstract = {Matrix projection models occupy a central role in population and conservation biology. Matrix models divide a population into discrete classes, even if the structuring trait exhibits continuous variation (e.g., body size). The integral projection model (IPM) avoids discrete classes and potential artifacts from arbitrary class divisions, facilitates parsimonious modeling based on smooth relationships between individual state and demographic performance, and can be implemented with standard matrix software. Here, we extend the IPM to species with complex demographic attributes, including dormant and active life stages, cross-classification by several attributes (e.g., size, age, and condition), and changes between discrete and continuous structure over the life cycle. We present a general model encompassing these cases, numerical methods, and theoretical results, including stable population growth and sensitivity/elasticity analysis for density-independent models, local stability analysis in density-dependent models, and optimal/evolutionarily stable strategy life-history analysis. Our presentation centers on an IPM for the thistle Onopordum illyricum based on a 6-year field study. Flowering and death probabilities are size and age dependent, and individuals also vary in a latent attribute affecting survival, but a predictively accurate IPM is completely parameterized by fitting a few regression equations.

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. In woodland herbs, the probability of flowering and costs associated with reproduction may strongly depend on environmental context (shade vs. light habitats) and on plant size. This may be particularly true for tuberous orchids that inhabit woodlands, as the amount of incoming radiation and total leaf area strongly determine photosynthetic capacity and hence the amount of carbohydrates that can be relocated to below-ground storage organs that form next year's rosette and flowering stalk. 2. To fully comprehend the impact of size-dependent reproduction on population dynamics under varying light conditions, life cycle models should therefore include plant size in a continuous manner. In this study, annual changes in plant size and demographic behaviour of the tuberous perennial orchid Orchis purpurea were monitored during seven consecutive years (2003-2009) in open and shaded woodland. Integral projection models (IPMs) and life table response experiments (LTRE) were used to investigate the extent to which variation in plant size affected the overall population dynamics of this species and to decompose differences in population growth rates between populations of open and shaded woodland into contributions from growth, survival and reproduction. 3. Both plants in shaded and light environments needed to be a certain size to initiate flowering, but this threshold size was almost three times as large in shaded environments as in light environments. Plants in open woodlands flowered more frequently over the years, showed less size regression after flowering and produced significantly more fruits than plants in shaded environments, resulting in significantly larger population growth rates. 4. Our life cycle models revealed that costs of reproduction, measured at the population-level, were small in the light environment, and more than buffered by the increase in survival of flowering plants compared to non-flowering plants. In the shade environment, however, the costs of reproduction were significant and made the difference between a stable (current) and a growing (without reproduction costs) population. 5. Synthesis. Light penetration to the soil is a key variable determining population dynamics of woodland orchids. Our analyses show that differences in vital rates related to size-dependent reproduction (flowering) and growth are essential drivers of changes in orchid population dynamics in different light environments. The combination of IPMs and LTREs thus proves to be very useful when studying the fitness consequences of size- and context-dependent phenomena like flowering strategies and costs of reproduction.},

abstract = {Environmental uncertainty alone can select for delayed reproduction; however, its relative role in the evolution of delayed reproduction across life histories is not known. Along a life-history spectrum from low-survival/high-fertility species to high-survival/low-fertility species, we show that the latter are more likely to evolve delayed reproduction if fertility varies over time. By contrast, if survival varies over time, low-survival life histories are more likely to evolve delays. If there is variation in both survival and fertility, and if this variation is positively associated, the evolutionarily stable reproductive delay is decreased (relative to independent variation in survival and fertility). Conversely, if variation in survival and fertility is negatively associated, the evolutionarily stable reproductive delay is increased. We further show that environmental uncertainty can drive the evolution of delayed reproduction in an iteroparous organism but only in the special case where juvenile survival is greater than adult survival. For common iteroparous life histories (adult survival 1 juvenile survival), environmental uncertainty does not select for delayed reproduction. Thus, any benefits that delayed reproduction might have on reproduction or survival could be especially important in explaining the common observation of delayed reproduction in many vertebrates and perennial plants.},

abstract = {We explore the effects of temporal variation in multiple demographic rates on the joint evolution of delayed reproduction and seed dormancy using integral projection models (IPMs). To do this, we extend the standard IPM to include a discrete state variable representing the number of seeds in the seed bank, density-dependent recruitment, and temporal variation in demography. Parameter estimates for Carlina vulgaris and Carduus nutans are obtained from long-term studies. Carlina is relatively long lived and has a short-lived seed bank, whereas most Carduus plants flower in their first year and the seed bank is long lived. Using the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) approach, we predict the observed flowering and germination strategies. There is excellent agreement between the predictions and the field observations. The effects of temporal variation on the joint ESS are partitioned into components arising from nonlinear averaging (systematic changes in the mean resulting from the interaction between variability and nonlinearity) and nonequilibrium dynamics (fluctuations in fitness caused by temporal variation). This shows that temporal variation can have substantial effects on the observed flowering and germination strategies and that covariance between demographic processes is important. We extend the models to include spatial population structure and assess the robustness of the results from the nonspatial models.},

This model assumes that there is a fixed amount of surplus energy which may be channeled into either somatic or gonadal tissue. The change in weight or length of a fish can be predicted from this model from the surplus energy and the gonadosomatic index. In many species the gonadosomatic index can be assumed to be a constant. Surplus energy can be estimated by inverting the growth equations. It is thereby possible to examine the consequences on Darwinian fitness of changes in the age at maturity or the allocation to reproduction as measured by changes in the gonadosomatic index. The allocation model is validated using data on growth of American plaice Hippoglossoides platessoides. The reproductive strategy of American plaice cannot be accounted for on the basis of the trade-off between growth and reproduction.-from Author},

The cost of reproduction as an evolutionary determinant of sexual dimorphism in life history traits in dioecious species was specifically tested, considering that the higher cost of reproduction in females has driven the life history traits related to sexual dimorphism. Females of woody dioecious species were consistently smaller than males supporting the costs of reproduction hypothesis. By contrast, females of her- baceous perennials were generally the larger sex, which did not fit the expectations of the hypothesis. Finally, the mechanisms that enable the compensation of the reproductive costs are detailed, including the plastic responses of photosynthesis and growth, the effects of the timing of investment, plant architecture and plant physiological integration.},

We examine whether populations display evidence of buffering against environmental variation in one of two ways: (1) through negative covariances among vital rates, or (2) reduction of variation in those vital rates to which population growth is most sensitive. We analyse time series of demographic data for 40 plant species and show that there is no evidence for either of these mechanisms. In species in which there is evidence for vital rate covariation, positive covariances between reproduction and survival rates predominate, and tend to magnify the effect of variability. Increasing climate variability is therefore expected to increase population fluctuations and extinction risks.},

abstract = {A tradeoff between growth and reproduction, often inferred from an inverse correlation between these two variables, is a fundamental paradigm of life-history evolution. Oak species provide a unique test of this relationship because different species mature acorns either in the year of pollination or in the year after pollination. This difference allows for an interspecific comparison testing whether the apparent tradeoff is causal or the result of confounding factors influencing growth and reproduction independently. Based on 13 years of data on five California oak species, we found significant negative correlations between radial growth and seed production in the three species that produce acorns the same year in which pollination occurs, but not in two species that mature acorns the year after pollination. Rainfall, which correlates positively with radial growth and correlates negatively with acorn production (based on the year of pollination), appears to be driving this pattern. We conclude that the observed negative correlations are not causal, but rather a consequence of growth and reproduction being dependent, in opposite ways, on environmental conditions. Thus, contrary to the current consensus, growth and reproduction in these species are apparently largely independent of each other. In contrast, tradeoffs between current and future reproduction appear to be much more important in the life-history evolution of these long-lived plants. We also conclude that a negative correlation does not necessarily imply a causal mechanism and should not be used as the only evidence supporting a tradeoff.},

A striking example of divergent life histories is the evolution of either iteroparity (breeding multiple times) or semelparity (breed once and die). We analysed published data on salmonid fishes and found that semelparous species produce larger eggs, that egg size and number increase with salmonid body size among populations and species and that migratory behaviour and parity interact. We developed three hypotheses that might explain the patterns in our data and evaluated them in a stage-structured modelling framework accounting for different growth and survival scenarios. Our models predict the observation of small eggs in iteroparous species when egg size is costly to maternal survival or egg number is constrained. By exploring trait co-variation in salmonids, we generate new hypotheses for the evolution of trade-offs among life history traits.},

For example, selection analysis can be used to predict changes in trait values, and by approximating selection, equations describing trait dynamics derived and evolutionary endpoints predicted. Here, we provide an overview of how these methods can be used to understand evolutionary dynamics and selection in a structured population modelled by an integral projection model (IPM). * General expressions for selection are given, and we show how these can be approximated using eigenvalue sensitivities. Approximations for the dynamics of both the trait mean and variance are presented and compared to simulation results (IPMs and individual-based models) for monocarpic perennials. * We describe how selection can be decomposed into components related to survival and reproduction and into components resulting from changes in demography versus changes in population structure. We show that, in an empirically based IPM, effects of changes in population structure can be a major component of the overall selection pressure. Most studies of selection in natural populations have focused entirely on selection due to changes in demography, so our results may help explain why directional selection is often predicted but no evolutionary response is observed. * The endpoints of evolution, what we expect to see in nature, are explored using ideas from adaptive dynamics theory. The key methods are based on evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) and convergence stability. Efficient methods for finding an ESS are described. We then extend these ideas to function-valued traits, where it is assumed that an entire function can evolve, rather than a few parameters defining it. * By combining theory for IPMs with ideas from several different fields, we show how the dynamics of ecologically complex, evolving systems can be understood.},

abstract = {The great taxonomic diversity of the Orchidaceae is often attributed to adaptive radiation for specific pollinators driven by selection for outcrossing. However, when one looks beyond the product to the process, the evidence for selection is less than overwhelming. We explore this problem by discussing relevant aspects of orchid biology and asking which aspects of reproduction explain the intricate pollination mechanisms and diversification of this family. We reaffirm that orchids are primarily pollination limited, the severity of which is affected by resource constraints. Fruit set is higher in temperate than in tropical species, and in species which offer pollinator rewards than those that do not. Reproductive success is skewed towards few individuals in a population and effective population sizes are often small. Population structure, reproductive success and gene flow among populations suggest that in many situations genetic drift may be as important as selection in fostering genetic and morphological variation in this family. Although there is some evidence for a gradualist model of evolutionary change, we believe that the great diversity in this family is largely a consequence of sequential and rapid interplay between drift and natural selection.},

abstract = {The number of times an organism reproduces (i.e., its mode of parity) is a fundamental life-history character, and evolutionary and ecological models that compare the relative fitnesses of different modes of parity are common in life-history theory and theoretical biology. Despite the success of mathematical models designed to compare intrinsic rates of increase (i.e., density-independent growth rates) between annual-semelparous and perennial-iteroparous reproductive schedules, there is widespread evidence that variation in reproductive allocation among semelparous and iteroparous organisms alike is continuous. This study reviews the ecological and molecular evidence for the continuity and plasticity of modes of parity—that is, the idea that annual-semelparous and perennial-iteroparous life histories are better understood as endpoints along a continuum of possible strategies. I conclude that parity should be understood as a continuum of different modes of parity, which differ by the degree to which they disperse or concentrate reproductive effort in time. I further argue that there are three main implications of this conclusion: (1) that seasonality should not be conflated with parity; (2) that mathematical models purporting to explain the general evolution of semelparous life histories from iteroparous ones (or vice versa) should not assume that organisms can only display either an annual-semelparous life history or a perennial-iteroparous one; and (3) that evolutionary ecologists should base explanations of how different life-history strategies evolve on the physiological or molecular basis of traits underlying different modes of parity.},

abstract = {1. Despite a large literature documenting the effects of mutualists and/or antagonists on plant performance, we still have limited insight into the strength of these interactions, as this involves quantifying how one species influences the population dynamics of another. 2. Here, we use data from two example systems, Cynoglossum officinale and Calathea ovandensis, to illustrate how experiments, demographic data and stage-based population models can be combined to estimate interaction strength of insect herbivores on plants. Because many plant populations may not be at equilibrium, we conduct transient analyses and contrast these results to more traditional asymptotic results. 3. We calculate three metrics of interaction strength, Delta lambda(asymptotic), the change in asymptotic annual per capita plant population growth rate resulting from herbivore exclusion, Delta lambda(t), the change in transient lambda caused by herbivores at t = M (where M = the time of their maximum effect during the transient phase) and Delta lambda(transient), a time-averaged effect of consumers on lambda across the entire transient phase. 4. Fairly strong impacts of insect consumers on plant fecundity do not translate similarly to Delta lambda(asymptotic). Results show that Delta lambda(t) can be larger (or smaller) than Delta lambda(asymptotic) but in our examples Delta lambda(transient) was similar in magnitude to Delta lambda(asymptotic). 5. The transient effects of consumers on lambda were driven by changes in the elasticity of fecundity across the transient phase. These effects were dynamic even though consumer impacts on demography and vital rates were held constant. The importance of particular stages and transitions to annual population growth vary during the transient phase. 6.Synthesis. We describe three metrics of interaction strength, Delta lambda(asymptotic), Delta lambda(t) and Delta lambda(transient). These metrics have several advantages over more commonly used trait or performance measures that quantify the outcome of interactions. We illustrate how the transient impacts of consumers on lambda are dynamic, with the changing stage distribution of a population and transient elasticities driving these effects. More generally, this study shows that the impacts of animals on plant performance do not translate equivalently to plant population growth, thereby underscoring the importance of using population models to extend the inference of individual-level experiments.},

abstract = {Costs of reproduction are pervasive in life history theory. Through this constraint, the reproductive effort of an organism at a given time negatively affects its later survival and fertility. For life historians, they correspond mostly to a physiological trade-off that stems from an allocative process, occurring at each time-step, at the level of the individual. For evolutionary demographers, they are essentially about genetic trade-offs, arising from a genetic variance in a pleiotropic gene acting antagonistically on early-age and late-age fitness components. The study, from an evolutionary demographic standpoint, of these mechanisms and of the relative, cross and joint effects of physiological and genetic costs, is the aim of this thesis. The close examination of Williams (1966)'s original definition of the physiological costs of reproduction led us to produce a theoretical design of their apparatus that accounts for both their mechanistic and evolutionary mechanisms. This design allowed us to make predictions with regards to the strength of costs of reproduction for various positions of organisms on three life-history spectra: slow-fast, income-capital breeders and quality-quantity. From Stearns (1989b)'s tryptic architecture of life history trade-offs –that divides their structure into the genotypic level, the intermediate structure and the phenotypic level – we devised a general framework, which models the possible cohabitation of both physiological and genetic costs. From this, we inferred differing detectability patterns of both types of costs according to the environmental conditions, their variance and individual stochasticity. We could also establish that both costs buffer environmental variations, but with varying time windows of effect. Their dissimilarity emerges also from the differences between mathematical projection models specific to each cost. A new family of evolutionary models is therefore required to implement both physiological and genetic trade-offs. We then describe the vector-based construction method for such a model which we call Multitrait Population Projection Matrix (MPPM) and which allows incorporating both types of costs by embedding them as traits into the matrix. We extend the classical sensitivity analysis techniques of evolutionary demography to MPPMs. Most importantly, we present a new analysis tool for both life history and evolutionary demography: the Trait Level Analysis. It consists in comparing pairs of models that share the same asymptotic properties. Such ergodic equivalent matrices are produced by folding, an operation that consists in reducing the number of traits of a multi-trait model, by averaging transitions for the traits folded upon, whilst still preserving the asymptotic flows. The Trait Level Analysis therefore allows, for example, to measure the evolutionary importance of costs of reproduction by comparing models incorporating them with folded versions of these models from which the costs are absent. Using classical and new methods to compute fitness moments – selection gradient, variance in reproductive success, environmental variance - in models with and without the costs, we can show their effects on various demographic and evolutionary measures. We reveal, in this way, the combined effects of genetic and physiological costs on the vital rates of an age-structured population. We also demonstrate how physiological costs affect both components of effective selection, as they flatten the slope of selection gradients and increase the effective size of a population. Finally, we show how their buffering of environmental and demographic variance confer greater resilience to populations experiencing physiological costs of reproduction. Lastly, we hint at the extension of such a multitrait model towards a new evolutionary demographic field, studying the coevolution of kinship distributions and biodemography, we call Kinship Demography. Kinship demography considers both the effects of kinship distribution on the demography of the population, which occur via the intra- and intergenerational transfers between kin, and the reciprocal influence of vital rates on the distribution of kin.},

abstract = {Abstract For structured populations with an annual breeding season, life-stage interactions and behavioral tactics may occur on a faster time scale than that of population dynamics. Motivated by recent field studies of the effect of rising sea surface temperature (SST) on within-breeding-season behaviors in colonial seabirds, we formulate and analyze a general class of discrete-time matrix models designed to account for changes in behavioral tactics within the breeding season and their dynamic consequences at the population level across breeding seasons. As a specific example, we focus on egg cannibalism and the daily reproductive synchrony observed in seabirds. Using the model, we investigate circumstances under which these life history tactics can be beneficial or non-beneficial at the population level in light of the expected continued rise in SST. Using bifurcation theoretic techniques, we study the nature of non-extinction, seasonal cycles as a function of environmental resource availability as they are created upon destabilization of the extinction state. Of particular interest are backward bifurcations in that they typically create strong Allee effects in population models which, in turn, lead to the benefit of possible (initial condition dependent) survival in adverse environments. We find that positive density effects (component Allee effects) due to increased adult survival from cannibalism and the propensity of females to synchronize daily egg laying can produce a strong Allee effect due to a backward bifurcation.},

However, it is conceptually and statistically challenging to distinguish these true post-reproductive stages from the usual processes of senescence, which can result in females occasionally surviving past their last reproductive event. Hence, despite considerable interest, the taxonomic prevalence of post-reproductive stages remains unclear and debated. In this study we use life tables constructed from pub- lished data on wild populations of mammals, and statistical measures of post-repro- ductive lifespans, to distinguish true post-reproductive stages from artefacts of senescence and demography in 52 species. We find post-reproductive stages are rare in mammals and are limited to humans and a few species of toothed whales. By re- solving this long-standing debate, we hope to provide clarity for researchers in the field of evolutionary biology and a solid foundation for further studies investigating the evolution and adaptive significance of this unusual life history trait.},

abstract = {The relative female and male contributions to demography are of great importance to better understand the history and dynamics of populations. While earlier studies relied on uniparental markers to investigate sex-specific questions, the increasing amount of sequence data now enables us to take advantage of tens to hundreds of thousands of independent loci from autosomes and the X chromosome. Here, we develop a novel method to estimate effective sex ratios or ESR (defined as the female proportion of the effective population) from allele count data for each branch of a rooted tree topology that summarizes the history of the populations of interest. Our method relies on Kimura's time-dependent diffusion approximation for genetic drift, and is based on a hierarchical Bayesian model to integrate over the allele frequencies along the branches. We show via simulations that parameters are inferred robustly, even under scenarios that violate some of the model assumptions. Analyzing bovine SNP data, we infer a strongly female-biased ESR in both dairy and beef cattle, as expected from the underlying breeding scheme. Conversely, we observe a strongly male-biased ESR in early domestication times, consistent with an easier taming and management of cows, and/or introgression from wild auroch males, that would both cause a relative increase in male effective population size. In humans, analyzing a subsample of non-African populations, we find a male-biased ESR in Oceanians that may reflect complex marriage patterns in Aboriginal Australians. Because our approach relies on allele count data, it may be applied on a wide range of species.},

abstract = {That population size affects the fate of new mutations arising in genomes, modulating both how frequently they arise and how efficiently natural selection is able to filter them, is well established. It is therefore clear that these distinct roles for population size that characterize different processes should affect the evolution of proteins and need to be carefully defined. Empirical evidence is consistent with a role for demography in influencing protein evolution, supporting the idea that functional constraints alone do not determine the composition of coding sequences. Given that the relationship between population size, mutant fitness and fixation probability has been well characterized, estimating fitness from observed substitutions is well within reach with well-formulated models. Molecular evolution research has, therefore, increasingly begun to leverage concepts from population genetics to quantify the selective effects associated with different classes of mutation. However, in order for this type of analysis to provide meaningful information about the intra- and inter-specific evolution of coding sequences, a clear definition of concepts of population size, what they influence, and how they are best parameterized is essential. Here, we present an overview of the many distinct concepts that “population size” and “effective population size” may refer to, what they represent for studying proteins, and how this knowledge can be harnessed to produce better specified models of protein evolution.},

abstract = {Cultural evolutionary theory and human behavioural ecology offer different, but compatible approaches to understanding human demographic behaviour. For much of their 30 history, these approaches have been deployed in parallel, with few explicit attempts to integrate them empirically. In this paper, we test hypotheses drawn from both approaches to explore how reproductive behaviour responds to cultural changes among Mosuo agriculturalists of China. Specifically, we focus on how age at last birth (ALB) varies in association with temporal shifts in fertility policies, spatial variation and kinship ecologies. We interpret temporal declines in ALB as plausibly consistent with demographic front-loading of reproduction in light of fertility constraints and later ages at last birth in matrilineal populations relative to patrilineal ones as consistent with greater household cooperation for reproductive purposes in the former. We find little evidence suggesting specific transmission pathways for the spread of norms regulating ALB, but emphasize that the rapid pace of change strongly suggests that learning processes were involved in the general decline in ALB over time. The different predictions of models we employ belie their considerable overlap and the potential for a synthetic approach to generate more refined tests of evolutionary hypotheses of demographic behaviour.This article is part of the theme issue 'Bridging cultural gaps: interdisciplinary studies in human cultural evolution'.},

abstract = {At the spatial scale relevant to many field studies and management policies, populations may experience more external recruitment than internal recruitment. These sources of recruitment, as well as local demography, are often subject to stochastic fluctuations in environmental conditions. Here, we introduce a class of stochastic models accounting for these complexities and provide analytic methods for understanding their long-term behavior. The population state n(x) of these stochastic models is a function or vector keeping track of densities of individuals with continuous (e.g. size) or discrete (e.g. age) traits x taking values in a compact metric space. This state variable is updated by a stochastic affine equation nt+1 = At+1nt + bt+1 where At+1 is a time varying operator (e.g. an integral operator or a matrix) that updates the local demography, and bt+1 is a time varying function or vector representing external recruitment. When the realized per-capita growth rate of the local demography is negative, we show that all initial conditions converge to the same time-varying trajectory. Furthermore, when A1, A2,... and b1, b2, ... are stationary sequences, this limiting behavior is determined by a unique stationary distribution. When the stationary sequences are periodic, uncorrelated, or a mixture of these two types of stationarity, we derive explicit formulas for the mean, within-year covariance, and auto-covariance of the stationary distribution. Sensitivity formulas for these statistical features are also given. The analtyic methods are illustrated with applications to discrete size-structured models of space-limited coral populations, and continuously size-structured models of giant clam populations.},

abstract = {The paper reviews current concepts that relate particular life-history strategies to habitat characteristics. The strategy selection system is described: through effects on the fitness of individual organisms in ecological time certain combinations of adaptations for survival and reproduction are selected. These combinations arise through trade-offs between different tactics. The author's hypothesis that the habitat provides the templet on which evolution forges characteristic life-history strategies is further explored and related to similar concepts proposed by others. It is shown that in general these formulations define habitat along two axes: one being the frequency of disturbances and the other the general level adversity or harshness. When these axes and the orientation of the figures are made to correspond, the predictions from the different approaches have many similarities. Although the habitat may be defined in terms of two abiotic axes, the scaling of these in time and space must be appropriate to the temporal (e.g. generation time) and spatial (e.g. trivial range) scales of the organism being considered. It is pointed out that the pattern of trade-offs will be constrained by the available genetic variability (a reflection of the organism's phylogenetic history) and there may be more than one stable strategy for a particular environment. The templet constrains the range of life-history strategies, but it does not impose uniformity. The extent of variation may correspond to the dichotomy between high risk and low risk strategies recently explored by Ellner.},

Past land use had a strong impact on species composition despite ceasing 100–200 years ago. Furthermore, edaphic–hydrological factors, treefall gaps, and an edge effect all had unique impacts on species composition. Hence, ecological determinism was evident in terms of both cross-landscape dominance and within-landscape variability in species composition. However, at the latter scale, the large portion of the explained variance in species com-position among plots uniquely attributed to spatial location pointed to an equally important role for neutral processes.},

abstract = {For effective management of endangered species it is pivotal to understand why a species is endangered and which key life cycle components are involved in its response to environmental changes. Our objective was to investigate the response of rosettes of the redlisted clonal herb Cirsium dissectum to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, which threatens its populations, and the consequences of these responses for its population dynamics. We constructed matrix population models with demographic data from three populations and four annual transitions and we decomposed the spatiotemporal variation in projected population growth rates into contributions from life cycle components. These patterns were compared with below-ground rosette dynamics in different fields, and with the below- and above-ground rosette dynamics in a garden experiment with nutrient enrichment and competing grasses. The decomposition analysis revealed that increased clonal rosette formation and decreased rosette survival were driving the spatial variation in the population growth rate. Excavating the below-ground rhizome network revealed a higher rosette turn-over in experimentally fertilized garden plots, which not only resulted in increased plot-level extinction, but also in increased spread of the clonal offspring. This supported the observed trend among field populations: rosette formation trades off with rosette survival. Surviving seedlings were only found in areas where the topsoil had been removed. The endangered C. dissectum is vulnerable when its habitat becomes more productive, because this species does not have the necessary capability to build up biomass. Small-scale disturbances such as created by sod-cutting or trampling cattle are essential for seedling establishment and necessary to render the explorative strategy of rhizomatous clonal spread successful.},

abstract = {1. A primary goal of evolutionary ecology is to understand factors selecting for the diversity of life histories. Life-history components, such as time-to-reproduction, adult survivorship and fecundity, might differ among species because of variation in direct and indirect benefits of these life histories in different environments or might have lower-than-expected variability because of phylogenetic constraints. Here, we present a phylogenetic examination of demography and life histories using a data base of 204 terrestrial plant species. 2. Overall, statistical models without phylogeny were preferred to models with phylogeny for vital rates and elasticities, suggesting that they lacked phylogenetic signal and are evolutionarily labile. However, the effect of phylogeny was significant in models including sensitivities, suggesting that sensitivities exhibit greater phylogenetic signal than vital rates or elasticities. 3. Species with a greater age at first reproduction had lower fecundity, consistent with a cost of delayed reproduction, but only in some habitats (e.g. grassland).We found no evidence for an indi- rect benefit of delayed reproduction via a decrease in variation in fecundity with age to first repro- duction. 4. The greater sensitivity and lower variation in survival than in fecundity was consistent with buf- fering of more important vital rates, as others have also found. This suggests that studies of life-his- tory evolution should include survival, rather than only fecundity, for themajority of species. 5. Synthesis. Demographic matrix models can provide informative tests of life-history theory because of their shared construction and outputs and their widespread use among plant ecologists. Our comparative analysis suggested that there is a cost of delayed reproduction and that more important vital rates exhibit lower variability. The absolute importance of vital rates to population growth rates (sensitivities) exhibited phylogenetic signal, suggesting that a thorough understanding of life-history evolution might require an understanding of the importance of vital rates, not just theirmeans, and the role of phylogenetic history.},

abstract = {Population projection (Lefkovitch) matrices are now a standard method for quantifying and analyzing the demography and population dynamics of plants. Elasticity analysis of such a matrix indicates the relative effect on the population growth rate (lambda) of small changes to matrix elements representing different transitions in the life cycle. In a comparison of elasticity matrices for 84 species of plants we show that the relative importance of recruitment from seed (measured by composite elasticity F), stasis (measured by composite elasticity L), and growth (measured by composite elasticity G) varies systematically between the groups semelparous herbs, iteroparous herbs of open habitats, forest herbs, shrubs, and trees. We discuss how this result might be used to construct rules of thumb useful in plant conservation. By looking in detail at how lambda covaries with the composite elasticities F, L, and G among 16 populations of the semelparous herb Cirsium vulgare and among 15 populations of the rare iteroparous herb Pedicularis furbishiae, we show that a naive interpretation of elasticities can give a misleading prescription for management. Instead, we show that elasticity analysis supports management prescriptions based upon the successional status of a species or upon its response to disturbance.},

abstract = {We present the first part of a quantitative theory for the structure and dynamics of forests at demographic and resource steady state. The theory uses allometric scaling relations, based on metabolism and biomechanics, to quantify how trees use resources, fill space, and grow. These individual-level traits and properties scale up to predict emergent properties of forest stands, including size–frequency distributions, spacing relations, resource flux rates, and canopy configurations. Two insights emerge from this analysis: () The size structure and spatial arrangement of trees in the entire forest are emergent manifestations of the way that functionally invariant xylem elements are bundled together to conduct water and nutrients up from the trunks, through the branches, to the leaves of individual trees. () Geometric and dynamic properties of trees in a forest and branches in trees scale identically, so that the entire forest can be described mathematically and behaves structurally and functionally like a scaled version of the branching networks in the largest tree. This quantitative framework uses a small number of parameters to predict numerous structural and dynamical properties of idealized forests. 10.1073/pnas.0812294106},

abstract = {▪ Abstract The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms.

abstract = {Genomic data are rapidly resolving the tree of living species calibrated to time, the timetree of life, which will provide a framework for research in diverse fields of science. Previous analyses of taxonomically restricted timetrees have found a decline in the rate of diversification in many groups of organisms, often attributed to ecological interactions among species. Here, we have synthesized a global timetree of life from 2,274 studies representing 50,632 species and examined the pattern and rate of diversification as well as the timing of speciation. We found that species diversity has been mostly expanding overall and in many smaller groups of species, and that the rate of diversification in eukaryotes has been mostly constant. We also identified, and avoided, potential biases that may have influenced previous analyses of diversification including low levels of taxon sampling, small clade size, and the inclusion of stem branches in clade analyses. We found consistency in time-to-speciation among plants and animals, ∼2 My, as measured by intervals of crown and stem species times. Together, this clock-like change at different levels suggests that speciation and diversification are processes dominated by random events and that adaptive change is largely a separate process.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: The open-data scientific philosophy is being widely adopted and proving to promote considerable progress in ecology and evolution. Open-data global data bases now exist on animal migration, species distribution, conservation status, etc. However, a gap exists for data on population dynamics spanning the rich diversity of the animal kingdom world-wide. This information is fundamental to our understanding of the conditions that have shaped variation in animal life histories and their relationships with the environment, as well as the determinants of invasion and extinction. Matrix population models (MPMs) are among the most widely used demographic tools by animal ecologists. MPMs project population dynamics based on the reproduction, survival and development of individuals in a population over their life cycle. The outputs from MPMs have direct biological interpretations, facilitating comparisons among animal species as different as Caenorhabditis elegans, Loxodonta africana and Homo sapiens. Thousands of animal demographic records exist in the form of MPMs, but they are dispersed throughout the literature, rendering comparative analyses difficult. Here, we introduce the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database, an open-data online repository, which in its version 1.0.0 contains data on 345 species world-wide, from 402 studies with a total of 1625 population projection matrices. COMADRE also contains ancillary information (e.g. ecoregion, taxonomy, biogeography, etc.) that facilitates interpretation of the numerous demographic metrics that can be derived from its MPMs. We provide R code to some of these examples.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSYNTHESIS: We introduce the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database, a resource for animal demography.

We also briefly discuss applications to combinatorial trees. In the continuous setting, we use the formalism of real trees, which yields an elegant formulation of the convergence of rescaled discrete trees towards continuous objects. We explain the coding of real trees by functions, which is a continuous version of the well-known coding of discrete trees by Dyck paths. We pay special attention to random real trees coded by Brownian excursions, and in a particular we provide a simple derivation of the marginal distributions of the CRT. The last section is an introduction to the theory of the Brownian snake, which combines the genealogical structure of random real trees with independent spatial motions.

Because the genealogical generations specifying kinship relations are not temporal cohorts and most plausible demographic changes in anthropological populations are period shocks, the effect of such shocks on kin counts are complex. Shocks increasing fertility or decreasing mortality produce larger numbers of kin per ego and decrease the inequality of the distribution of kin and vice versa. Effects are more diffuse at more distant collateral ranges. Effects are stronger the more intense the shock and the longer its duration. Kinship distributions return to their initial state after the shock and as the original age structure of the population is ergodically reattained. Alternating shocks produce more complex patterns. Implications of these outcomes are that opportunities for political networking and consolidation by means of kinship are altered by demographic instabilities, as are the dynamics of kin selection. This analysis is limited for simplicity to unilineal agnatic reckoning of kin.},

abstract = {Developmental constraints (defined as biases on the production of variant phenotypes or limitations on phenotypic variability caused by the structure, character, composition, or dynamics of the developmental system) undoubtedly play a significant role in evolution. Yet there is little agreement on their importance as compared with selection, drift, and other such factors in shaping evolutionary history. This review distinguishes between "universal" and "local" constraints; it deals primarily with the latter, which apply to a limited range of taxa. Such constraints, typically, can be broken even within the taxa to which they apply, though with varying degrees of difficulty. The origin of constraints is discussed, five distinctive of constraint being explicitly considered. Three means of identifying constraints are set forth, as well as four means of distinguishing developmental from selective constraints. None of the latter (use of a priori adaptive predictions, direct measurement of selection, direct measurement of heritable variation, and use of the comparative method) is foolproof. In the final section, three larger issues regarding the role of developmental constraints in evolution are discussed: the extent to which evolutionary stasis can be explained in developmental terms, the extend to which evolutionary trends and patterns might be a consequence of developmental constraints, and the extent to which various genetic and developmental mechanisms have evolved in virtue of the need of lineages to manifest evolutionary plasticity (or adaptability) if they are to survive. Although no definitive conclusions are reached on these larger issues, we bring recent advances in developmental biology, evolutionary theory, and (to a limited extent) molecular biology to bear on them.},

abstract = {Humans and other primates are distinct among placental mammals in having exceptionally slow rates of growth, reproduction, and aging. Primates' slow life history schedules are generally thought to reflect an evolved strategy of allocating energy away from growth and reproduction and toward somatic investment, particularly to the development and maintenance of large brains. Here we examine an alternative explanation: that primates' slow life histories reflect low total energy expenditure (TEE) (kilocalories per day) relative to other placental mammals. We compared doubly labeled water measurements of TEE among 17 primate species with similar measures for other placental mammals. We found that primates use remarkably little energy each day, expending on average only 50{\%} of the energy expected for a placental mammal of similar mass. Such large differences in TEE are not easily explained by differences in physical activity, and instead appear to reflect systemic metabolic adaptation for low energy expenditures in primates. Indeed, comparisons of wild and captive primate populations indicate similar levels of energy expenditure. Broad interspecific comparisons of growth, reproduction, and maximum life span indicate that primates' slow metabolic rates contribute to their characteristically slow life histories.},

abstract = {The evolution of cooperation among animals has posed a major problem for evolutionary biologists, and despite decades of research into avian cooperative breeding systems, many questions about the evolution of their societies remain unresolved. A review of the kin structure of avian societies shows that a large majority live in kin-based groups. This is consistent with the proposed evolutionary routes to cooperative breeding via delayed dispersal leading to family formation, or limited dispersal leading to kin neighbourhoods. Hypotheses proposed to explain the evolution of cooperative breeding systems have focused on the role of population viscosity, induced by ecological/demographic constraints or benefits of philopatry, in generating this kin structure. However, comparative analyses have failed to generate robust predictions about the nature of those constraints, nor differentiated between the viscosity of social and non-social populations, except at a coarse level. I consider deficiencies in our understanding of how avian dispersal strategies differ between social and non-social species, and suggest that research has focused too narrowly on population viscosity and that a broader perspective that encompasses life history and demographic processes may provide fresh insights into the evolution of avian societies.},

abstract = {In animal societies, kin selection is a critical evolutionary process, with cooperation evolving principally among relatives living in kin-structured populations. Theoretical and empirical studies have largely focused on population viscosity-the timing or distance of dispersal-as the key factor generating kin structure. This is despite extensive theoretical broadening of the factors and processes influencing effective population size, variance in reproduction, and relatedness. Here, we explore predation mortality as a specific driver of population-level reproductive skew and variance in fecundity to show how a common and perhaps underappreciated event in organism life history can give rise to patterns of relatedness. We develop our case study around an empirically derived model where elevated relatedness arises from predation that alters the timing and nature of offspring mortality, essentially driving variance in fecundity. This leads to dramatic changes in the emergent kin structure of the surviving breeding population. Our in-silico experiments recover the theoretical predictions that when predation acts on clusters of individuals and effectively removes whole family groups (i.e., broods), rather than individuals, from the pool of potential recruits, there is a greater kin structure in the emergent adult population. We conclude that empirical attempts to understand the factors promoting kin-structured populations and the evolution of sociality should now match theoretical efforts to be more inclusive of ecological process generating life history and demographic variability.},

abstract = {Long life is a typical feature of individuals living in cooperative societies. One explanation is that group living lowers mortality, which selects for longer life. Alternatively, long life may make the evolution of cooperation more likely by ensuring a long breeding tenure, making helping behaviour and queuing for breeding positions worthwhile. The benefit of queuing will, however, depend on whether individuals gain indirect fitness benefits while helping, which is determined by female promiscuity. Where promiscuity is high and therefore the indirect fitness benefits of helping are low, cooperation can still be favoured by an even longer life span. We present the results of comparative analyses designed to test the likelihood of a causal relationship between longevity and cooperative breeding by reconstructing ancestral states of cooperative breeding across birds, and by examining the effect of female promiscuity on the relationship between these two traits. We found that long life makes the evolution of cooperation more likely and that promiscuous cooperative species are exceptionally long lived. These results make sense of promiscuity in cooperative breeders and clarify the importance of life-history traits in the evolution of cooperative breeding, illustrating that cooperation can evolve via the combination of indirect and direct fitness benefits.},

Particularly vexing has been identifying the ecological correlates of this phenomenon, which has been suggested to be favored in populations inhabiting both relatively stable, productive environments and in populations living under highly variable and unpredictable conditions. Griesser et al. provide a novel approach to this problem, performing a phylogenetic analysis indicating that family living is an intermediate step between nonsocial and cooperative breeding birds. They then examine the ecological and climatic conditions associated with these different social systems, concluding that cooperative breeding emerges when family living is favored in highly productive environments, followed secondarily by selection for cooperative breeding when environmental conditions deteriorate and within-year variability increases. Combined with recent work addressing the fitness consequences of cooperative breeding, Griesser et al.'s contribution stands to move the field forward by demonstrating that the evolution of complex adaptations such as cooperative breeding may only be understood when each of the steps leading to it are identified and carefully integrated.},

Biparental care by a pair-bonded male and female is the most common pattern of care but at 81{\%} of species, the pattern is less common than once believed.

abstract = {Cooperative breeding is a widespread and intense form of cooperation, in which individuals help raise offspring that are not their own. This behaviour is particularly well studied in birds, using both long-term and comparative studies that have provided insights into the evolution of reproductive altruism. In most cooperatively breeding species, helpers are offspring that remain with their parents beyond independency and help in the raising of younger siblings. However, many cooperatively breeding species are poorly studied, and in 152 species, this behaviour only has been observed infrequently (i.e., occasional cooperative breeding). Here we argue that the parental care mode of these 152 species needs to be treated with caution, as factors associated with occasional cooperative breeding may differ from those associated with “regular” cooperative breeding. In most cooperatively breeding species, helpers provide alloparental care at the nests of their parents or close relatives; however, only in one occasionally cooperatively breeding species do offspring remain into the next breeding season with their parents. Accordingly, different factors are likely to be associated with regular and occasional cooperative breeding. The latter behaviour resembles interspecific feeding (i.e., individuals feed offspring of another species), which occurs when birds lose their brood and begin feeding at a nearby nest, or when birds mistakenly feed at another nest. Thus, we advise researchers to exclude occasional cooperative breeders in comparative analyses until their status is clarified, or to categorize them separately or according to the typically observed parental care mode. This approach will increase the robustness of comparative analyses and thereby improve our understanding of factors that drive the evolution of cooperative breeding.},

Selection on the timing of reproduction is well studied in semelparous organisms because the cost of reproduction (death) can be easily incorporated into demographic models. Iteroparous organisms also exhibit delayed reproduction and experience reproductive costs, although these are not necessarily lethal. How non-lethal costs shape iteroparous life histories remains unresolved. We analysed long-term demographic data for the iteroparous orchid Orchis purpurea from two habitat types (light and shade). In both the habitats, flowering plants had lower growth rates and this cost was greater for smaller plants. We detected an additional growth cost of fruit production in the light habitat. We incorporated these non-lethal costs into integral projection models to identify the flowering size that maximizes fitness. In both habitats, observed flowering sizes were well predicted by the models. We also estimated optimal parameters for size-dependent flowering effort, but found a strong mismatch with the observed flower production. Our study highlights the role of context-dependent non-lethal reproductive costs as selective forces in the evolution of iteroparous life histories, and provides a novel and broadly applicable approach to studying the evolutionary demography of iteroparous organisms.},

abstract = {Cooperative breeding is an extreme form of cooperation that evolved in a range of lineages, including arthropods, fish, birds, and mammals. Although cooperative breeding in birds is widespread and well-studied, the conditions that favored its evolution are still unclear. Based on phylogenetic comparative analyses on 3,005 bird species, we demonstrate here that family living acted as an essential stepping stone in the evolution of cooperative breeding in the vast majority of species. First, families formed by prolonging parent±offspring associations beyond nutritional independency, and second, retained offspring began helping at the nest. These findings suggest that assessment of the conditions that favor the evolution of cooperative breeding can be confounded if this process is not considered to include 2 steps. Specifically, phylogenetic linear mixed models show that the formation of families was associated with more productive and seasonal environments, where prolonged parent± offspring associations are likely to be less costly. However, our data show that the subsequent evolution of cooperative breeding was instead linked to environments with variable productivity, where helpers at the nest can buffer reproductive failure in harsh years. The proposed 2-step framework helps resolve current disagreements about the role of environmental forces in the evolution of cooperative breeding and better explains the geographic distribution of this trait. Many geographic hotspots of cooperative breeding have experienced a historical decline in productivity, suggesting that a higher proportion of family-living species could have been able to avoid extinction under harshening conditions through the evolution of cooperative breeding. These findings underscore the importance of considering the potentially different factors that drive different steps in the evolution of complex adaptations.},

abstract = {The importance of social- and kin-structuring of populations for the transmission of wildlife disease is widely assumed but poorly described. Social structure can help dilute risks of transmission for group members, and is relatively easy to measure, but kin-association represents a further level of population sub-structure that is harder to measure, particularly when association behaviours happen underground. Here, using epidemiological and molecular genetic data from a wild, high-density population of the European badger ( Meles meles ), we quantify the risks of infection with Mycobacterium bovis (the causative agent of tuberculosis) in cubs. The risk declines with increasing size of its social group, but this net dilution effect conceals divergent patterns of infection risk. Cubs only enjoy reduced risk when social groups have a higher proportion of test-negative individuals. Cubs suffer higher infection risk in social groups containing resident infectious adults, and these risks are exaggerated when cubs and infectious adults are closely related. We further identify key differences in infection risk associated with resident infectious males and females. We link our results to parent–offspring interactions and other kin-biased association, but also consider the possibility that susceptibility to infection is heritable.

abstract = {Traditional interpretations of the evolution of animal societies have suggested that their structure is a consequence of attempts by individuals to maximize their inclusive fitness within constraints imposed by their social and physical environments. In contrast, some recent re-interpretations have argued that many aspects of social organization should be interpreted as group-level adaptations maintained by selection operating between groups or populations. Here, I review our current understanding of the evolution of mammalian societies, focusing, in particular, on the evolution of reproductive strategies in societies where one dominant female monopolizes reproduction in each group and her offspring are reared by other group members. Recent studies of the life histories of females in these species show that dispersing females often have little chance of establishing new breeding groups and so are likely to maximize their inclusive fitness by helping related dominants to rear their offspring. As in eusocial insects, increasing group size can lead to a progressive divergence in the selection pressures operating on breeders and helpers and to increasing specialization in their behaviour and life histories. As yet, there is little need to invoke group-level adaptations in order to account for the behaviour of individuals or the structure of mammalian groups.},

abstract = {n this article, we investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of predator and prey populations using an individual-based modeling approach. In our models, the individual is the fundamental unit, and the dynamics are governed by individual rules for growth, movement, reproduction, feeding, and mortality. We first establish the congruence between age-structured predator-prey population models and the corresponding individual-based population model un- der homogeneous spatial conditions. Given the agreement between the formalisms, we then use the individual-based model to investigate the dynamics of spatially structured predator-prey systems. In particular, we contrast the dynamics of predator-prey systems in which predators adopt either an "ambush" or a "cruising" strategy. We show that the stability of the spatially structured predator-prey system depends on the relative mobility of prey and predators and that prey mobility, in particular, has a strong effect on stability. Local density dependence in prey reproduction can quantitatively alter the asymmetrical influence of prey mobility on stability, but we show that the asymmetry exists when local density dependence is removed. We hypothe- size that this asymmetrical response is due to prey "escape" in space caused by differences in rates of spread of prey and predator populations that arise because of fundamental differences between prey and predator reproduction},

The established approach that starts with formulating and analyzing strategic, and population-level models for broad insights has been challenged and subsequently details to the emerging picture by studying more mechanistic, individual based models have been added. A paradigm starts with the bottom-up modeling of an ecological system and carefully accounts for the individual level mechanisms that make the system tick. The level of the individual organism is the natural basic scale at which this modeling process should be started because at this scale the elementary processes of population dynamics take place. Bottom-up and top-down models should hence be the start and the end point, respectively, of a theoretical development, which should progress from complex to simple as opposed to the other way around. Only such a bottom-up to top-down approach will ensure that the required generality of models will be in their results and not in their assumptions. {\textcopyright} 2005 Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper is as much about a certain modelling methodology, as it is about the constructive definition of future population states from a description of individual behaviour and an initial population state. The key idea is to build a nonlinear model in two steps, by explicitly introducing the environmental condition via the requirement that individuals are independent from one another (and hence equations are linear) when this condition is prescribed as a function of time. A linear physiologically structured population model is defined by two rules, one for reproduction and one for development and survival, both depending on the initial individual state and the prevailing environmental condition. In Part I we showed how one can constructively define future population state operators from these two ingredients. A nonlinear model is a linear model together with a feedback law that describes how the environmental condition at any particular time depends on the population size and composition at that time. When applied to the solution of the linear problem, the feedback law yields a fixed point problem. This we solve constructively by means of the contraction mapping principle, for any given initial population state. Using subsequently this fixed point as input in the linear population model, we obtain a population semiflow. We then say that we solved the nonlinear problem.},

abstract = {Population dynamics result from the interplay of density-independent and density-dependent processes. Understanding this interplay is important, especially for being able to predict near-term population trajectories for management. In recent years, the study of model systems-experimental, observational and theoretical-has shed considerable light on the way that the both density-dependent and -independent aspects of the environment affect population dynamics via impacting on the organism's life history and therefore demography. These model-based approaches suggest that (i) individuals in different states differ in their demographic performance, (ii) these differences generate structure that can fluctuate independently of current total population size and so can influence the dynamics in important ways, (iii) individuals are strongly affected by both current and past environments, even when the past environments may be in previous generations and (iv) dynamics are typically complex and transient due to environmental noise perturbing complex population structures. For understanding population dynamics of any given system, we suggest that 'the devil is in the detail'. Experimental dissection of empirical systems is providing important insights into the details of the drivers of demographic responses and therefore dynamics and should also stimulate theory that incorporates relevant biological mechanism.},

The first is the probability of the parent being alive, the second term involves the mechanism by which individuals are sampled, and the third term is a contribution from the observed age of the parent. A stable age distribution in the population is assumed, and we provide an expression for how this distribution is perturbed by the information that an individual has given birth at a particular time point in the past or in the future. Calculations are performed from the perspective of the offspring, but we also make comparison to the situation where the perspective is put on the parent. Although the resulting probabilities are the same, the actual calculations differ, due to the asymmetry of a parent–offspring relationship.},

abstract = {Abstract Most mammalian populations suffer from natural or human-induced disturbances; populations are no longer at the equilibrium (i.e., at stable [st]age distribution) and exhibit transient dynamics. From a literature survey, we studied patterns of transient dynamics for mammalian species spanning a large range of life-history tactics and population growth rates. For each population, we built an age-structured matrix and calculated six metrics of transient dynamics. After controlling for possible confounding effects of the phylogenetic relatedness among species using a phylogenetic principal component analysis and phylogenetic generalized least squares models, we found that short-term demographic responses of mammalian populations to disturbance are shaped by generation time and growth rate. Species with a slow pace of life (i.e., species with a late maturity, a low fecundity, and a long life span) displayed decreases in population size after a disturbance, whereas fast-living species increased in population size. The magnitude of short-term variation in population size increased with asymptotic population growth, being buffered in slow-growing species (i.e., species with a low population growth rate) but large in fast-growing species. By demonstrating direct links between transient dynamics, life history (generation time), and ecology (demographic regime), our comparative analysis of transient dynamics clearly improves our understanding of population dynamics in variable environments and has clear implications for future studies of the interplay between evolutionary and ecological dynamics. As most populations in the wild are not at equilibrium, we recommend that analyses of transient dynamics be performed when studying population dynamics in variable environments.},

After a short review, we introduce a stochastic individual-centered particle model to describe the evolution in continuous time of a population with (continuous) age and trait structures. The individuals reproduce asexually, age, interact and die. The 'trait' is an individual heritable property (d-dimensional vector) that may influence birth and death rates and interactions between individuals, and vary by mutation. In a large population limit, the random process converges to the solution of a Gurtin-McCamy type PDE. We show that the random model has a long time behavior that differs from its deterministic limit. However, the results on the limiting PDE and large deviation techniques textit`a la Freidlin-Wentzell provide estimates of the extinction time and a better understanding of the long time behavior of the stochastic process. This has applications to the theory of adaptive dynamics used in evolutionary biology. We present simulations for two biological problems involving life-history trait evolution when body size is plastic and individual growth is taken into account.},

abstract = {The relative role of dynamic and fixed heterogeneity in shaping the individual heterogeneity observed in most life-history traits remains difficult to quantify. In a recent work, . Tuljapurkar etal. (2009) suggested modeling individual heterogeneity in lifetime reproductive success by a null model building reproductive trajectories from a first-order Markov chain. According to this model, among-individual differences in reproductive trajectories would be generated by the stochastic transitions among reproductive states (such as breeder and non-breeder) due to dynamic heterogeneity. In this work, we analyze the individual variation in three reproductive metrics (reproductive status, fecundity, and reproductive success) in two populations of roe deer intensively monitored using Tuljapurkar etal. (2009)'s dynamic model. Moreover, we challenge the Tuljapurkar model previously used as a biological null model to test whether the observed distribution of reproductive success over the lifetime was generated by a stochastic process by modifying two steps of the previous model to build a full stochastic model. We show that a distribution generated by the full dynamic model proposed by Tuljapurkar etal. (2009) can be consistently interpreted as only generated from a stochastic biological process provided that the probabilities of transition among reproductive states used are independent of the current reproductive state and that the positive co-variation that usually occurs between survival and reproduction among individuals is removed. Only the reproductive status of roe deer females could be restricted to a stochastic process described by the full stochastic model, probably because most females ({\textgreater}90{\%}) were breeders in a given year. The fecundity of roe deer females could not be adequately described by the full dynamic and full stochastic model, and the observed distribution of female reproductive success differed from the one generated by a full dynamic model in which each individual reproductive trajectory was independent of the individual lifespan (second step of the full dynamic model changed). While there was clear evidence that dynamic heterogeneity occurred and accounted for a large part of the observed among-individual variation in reproductive trajectories of roe deer females, a stochastic process did not provide a suitable model for all reproductive metrics. Consequently, models including additional fixed and dynamic traits need to be built in order to separate the relative role of fixed and dynamic heterogeneities in generating reproductive trajectories. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Gaillard2017,
abstract = {Williams' evolutionary theory of senescence based on antagonistic pleiotropy has become a landmark in evolutionary biology, and more recently in biogerontology and evolutionary medicine. In his original article, Williams launched a set of nine 'testable deductions' from his theory. Although some of these predictions have been repeatedly discussed, most have been overlooked and no systematic evaluation of the whole set of Williams' original predictions has been performed. For the sixtieth anniversary of the publication of the Williams' paper, we provide an updated evaluation of all these predictions. We present the pros and cons of each prediction based on recent accumulation of both theoretical and empirical studies performed in the laboratory and in the wild. From our viewpoint, six predictions are mostly supported by our current knowledge at least under some conditions (although Williams' theory cannot thoroughly explain why for some of them). Three predictions, all involving the timing of senescence, are not supported. Our critical review of Williams' predictions highlights the importance of William's contribution},

This insight is obvious for certain types of kin-as fertility falls, parents have fewer children, for instance-but its broader implications for communities remain unexplored. Prior work on this topic has focused on how the demographic transition reshapes the availability of living kin within a society over time to the neglect of how differences in the demographic transition lead to differences in kinship networks between communities. In this article, I examine survey data (for rural Thailand) and use microsimulation methods to test how different pathways through the demographic transition affect kinship networks in communities. My results show that different routes through the demographic transition can substantially alter kinship network size and, entirely through the mechanism of demographic change, have indirect effects on community integration. These effects persist long after the demographic transition has ended. I theorize reasons that community-level differentiation in kinship networks owing to the demographic transition are an important mechanism linking the demographic transition to modernity.},

abstract = {Among the factors that may reduce the predictability of evolution, chaos, characterized by a strong dependence on initial condi-tions, has received much less attention than randomness due to genetic drift or environmental stochasticity. It was recently shown that chaos in phenotypic evolution arises commonly under frequency-dependent selection caused by competitive interactions mediated by many traits. This result has been used to argue that chaos should often make evolutionary dynamics unpredictable. However, populations also evolve largely in response to external changing environments, and such environmental forcing is likely to influence the outcome of evolution in systems prone to chaos. We investigate how a changing environment causing oscillations of an optimal phenotype interacts with the internal dynamics of an eco-evolutionary system that would be chaotic in a constant environment. We show that strong environmental forcing can improve the predictability of evolution by reducing the probability of chaos arising, and by dampening the magnitude of chaotic oscillations. In contrast, weak forcing can increase the probability of chaos, but it also causes evolutionary trajectories to track the environment more closely. Overall, our results indicate that, although chaos may occur in evolution, it does not necessarily undermine its predictability.},

Two selective regimes represented conditions before and after the impoundment of a river, blocking access of anadromous white sturgeon populations to the ocean. In contrast to previous simulation studies, I found that increased individual variation in the age at maturity did not necessarily lead to a higher likelihood of persistence. Individual variation increased the simulated likelihood of persistence when the variation was heritable and the selective regime had changed such that the mean age at maturity was no longer optimal.

In these cases, the underlying genetic circuits leverage the intrinsic stochasticity of intracellular chemistry to drive transition between states. Understanding how these circuits transform transient gene expression fluctuations into lasting phenotypic programs will require a combination of quantitative modeling and extensive, time-resolved observation of switching events in single cells. In this article, we survey microbial cell fate decisions demonstrated to involve a random element, describe theoretical frameworks for understanding stochastic switching between states, and highlight recent advances in microfluidics that will enable characterization of key dynamic features of these circuits.},

@article{Grimm1999,
abstract = {Each modeller who builds and analyses an individual-based model learns of course a great deal, but what has ecology as a whole learned from the individual-based models published during the last decade? Answering this question proves extremely difficult as there is no common motivation behind individual-based models. The distinction is introduced between 'pragmatic' motivation, which uses the individual-based approach as a tool without any reference to the theoretical issues which have emerged from the classical state variable approach and 'paradigmatic' motivation, which explicitly refers to theoretical ecology. A mini-review of 50 individual-based animal population models shows that the majority are driven by pragmatic motivation. Most models are very complex and special techniques to cope with this complexity during their analysis are only occasionally applied. It is suggested that in order to orient individual-based modelling more towards general theoretical issues, we need increased explicit reference to theoretical ecology and an advanced strategy for building and analysing individual-based models. To this end, a heuristic list of rules is presented which may help us to advance the practice of individual-based modelling and to learn more general lessons from individual-based modelling in the future than we have during the last decade. The main ideas behind these rules are as follows: (1) Individual-based models usually make more realistic assumptions than state variable models, but it should not be forgotten that the aim of individual-based modelling is not 'realism' but modelling. (2) The individual-based approach is a bottom-up approach which starts with the 'parts' (i.e. individuals) of a system (i.e. population) and then tries to understand how the system's properties emerge from the interaction among these parts. However, bottom-up approaches alone will never lead to theories at the systems level. State variable or top-down approaches are needed to provide an appropriate integrated view, i.e. the relevant questions at the population level.},

Anthropogenic changes may amplify or impede these patterns of variation, and may have positive or negative effects on population growth. Using stochastic population projection matrix models, we develop stochastic elasticities (proportional derivatives of the long-run population growth rate) to gauge the population effects of three types of change in demographic variability (changes in within- and between-disturbance-phase variability and phase-specific changes). Computing these elasticities for five species of disturbance-influenced perennial plants, we pinpoint demographic rates that may reveal adaptation to disturbance, and we demonstrate that species may differ in their responses to different types of changes in demographic variability driven by climate change.},

This second process is required to explain the near non-senescence of old mothers offspring and the lack of a mother offspring correlation in age at death. We observed that life span is predominantly determined by underlying stochastic stage dynamics.

abstract = {A discrete unstructured population model with nonoverlapping generations is used to calculate the probability of extinction as a function of the number of generations elapsed and the initial population size. This formulation accounts for demographic effects, environmental variation, and catastrophic mortality. Accurate approximations are developed for large carrying capacity and large time. The main qualitative results are as follows: The probability of early extinction depends strongly on the initial population size. A substantial fraction of small starting populations become extinct within a short time. Those that survive the initial period typically survive for a long time. This skew in extinction times makes the expected time to extinction a misleading indicator. Probabilities of extinction are sensitive to environmental variation in the net reproductive rate and the shape of the distribution of disturbances, not just its mean. Probabilities of extinction are likewise sensitive to the rate of catastrophe occurrences and the shape of the catastrophe distribution, not just its mean. Diffusion approximations are likely to be inaccurate for small populations or for populations that show large changes in size in a single generation. These difficulties may be overcome by use of an extrapolation based on solutions for discrete population size and time.},

abstract = {Evolutionary graph theory has grown to be an area of intense study. Despite the amount of interest in the field, it seems to have grown separate from other subfields of population genetics and evolution. In the current work I introduce the concept of Fisher's (1930) reproductive value into the study of evolution on graphs. Reproductive value is a measure of the expected genetic contribution of an individual to a distant future generation. In a heterogeneous graph-structured population, differences in the number of connections among individuals translate into differences in the expected number of offspring, even if all individuals have the same fecundity. These differences are accounted for by reproductive value. The introduction of reproductive value permits the calculation of the fixation probability of a mutant in a neutral evolutionary process in any graph-structured population for either the moran birth-death or death-birth process. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Using models for unstructured populations, we investigate the effect of environmental variability on population growth when the environment affects vital rates through nonlinear functions. We focus here especially on interannual variation in food resources availability, for which sigmoid functions are relevant. Considering first unregulated populations in stochastic environments, we show that classic sigmoid annual growth rates cannot lead to positive effects of increased environmental variability on population growth. This is true even when the temporal average of food availability is low, and Jensen's inequality predicts an increased arithmetic mean of the annual growth rate. The result is due to the log-concavity of many sigmoid (and other accelerating) functions, as convexity of the logarithm of the annual growth rate is needed for positive effects of variability to appear. Then, separating the effects of a food availability variable on reproduction and survival rates, we show that populations with less sensitive survival rate to food are more likely to benefit from food variability-as opposed to populations that have survival rates accelerating with food availability, which is rather counterintuitive given Jensen's inequality. Again, this is explained by log-convexity properties of nonlinear functions. We further extend these results to regulated populations, in which similar positive effects of food variability can affect average population size. Positive variability effects seem however more likely to occur in regulated populations. Finally, we extend our results to stage-structured populations. We connect to the previous work showing positive effects of environmental variability with matrix models, and show that these effects are well captured by simpler unstructured models. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Analyzing this trajectory is crucial for understanding biological and sociocultural processes that determine the span of life. Here we reveal a fundamental regularity. Two straight lines describe the joint rise of life expectancy and lifespan equality: one for primates and the second one over the full range of human experience from average lifespans as low as 2 y during mortality crises to more than 87 y for Japanese women today. Across the primate order and across human populations, the lives of females tend to be longer and less variable than the lives of males, suggesting deep evolutionary roots to the male disadvantage.

A positive linear combination of age classes (e.g., weighted by body mass) is assumed to act as the single variable of population size, [Formula: see text], exerting density dependence on age-specific vital rates through an increasing function of population size. The environment fluctuates in a stationary distribution with no autocorrelation. We show by analysis and simulation of age structure, under assumptions often met by vertebrate populations, that the stochastic dynamics of population size can be accurately approximated by a univariate model governed by three key demographic parameters: the intrinsic rate of increase and carrying capacity in the average environment, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], and the environmental variance in population growth rate, [Formula: see text] Allowing these parameters to be genetically variable and to evolve, but assuming that a fourth parameter, [Formula: see text], measuring the nonlinearity of density dependence, remains constant, the expected evolution maximizes [Formula: see text] This shows that the magnitude of environmental stochasticity governs the classical trade-off between selection for higher [Formula: see text] versus higher [Formula: see text] However, selection also acts to decrease [Formula: see text], so the simple life-history trade-off between [Formula: see text]- and [Formula: see text]-selection may be obscured by additional trade-offs between them and [Formula: see text] Under the classical logistic model of population growth with linear density dependence ([Formula: see text]), life-history evolution in a fluctuating environment tends to maximize the average population size.},

Two non-exclusive hypotheses may explain such variability. It could be the expression of different individual strategies, i.e., different allocation strategies in fitness components, or the consequences of individual difference in intrinsic quality, i.e., some individuals always doing better than others in all fitness components. We tested these hypotheses in the Wandering Albatross investigating relationships between the age at first reproduction and subsequent adult demographic traits. Using finite mixture capture recapture modeling, we demonstrate that the age at first reproduction is negatively related to both reproductive performances and adult survival, suggesting that individual quality was an important factor explaining variation in the age at first reproduction. Our results suggest that age at first breeding is a good predictor of quality in this long-lived seabird species.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

abstract = {As tradeoff s limit the maximum Darwinian fi tness individuals can reach, measuring reliably the strength of tradeoff s using appropriate metrics is of prime importance to understand the evolution of traits under constraints. Tradeoff s involving phenotypic traits and fi tness components, however, are diffi cult to quantify in free-ranging populations because of confounding eff ects due to environmental variation and individual heterogeneity. Furthermore, although some methods have been used previously to quantify tradeoff s, these methods cannot be applied with respect to binary traits, which are common to describe life histories (e.g. probability of reproduction, nesting success, off spring survival). Here, we demon- strate how to measure reliably the strength of tradeoff s involving binary traits using (auto)correlation estimates obtained from generalized linear (mixed) models. We fi rst propose a standardized approach that accounts for the variation in the nature of the tradeoff s being compared (e.g. continuous/binary traits, repeated/non-repeated measures), and then apply this method to longitudinal data from two contrasting species of large herbivores. Empirical estimates of tradeoff s varied among traits, and between-species comparisons suggested that reproductive tradeoff s between successive breeding attempts might only occur in capital breeders. Th e empirical results we obtained clearly demonstrate that the method we provide allows measuring reliably the strength of tradeoff s under most circumstances, including tradeoff s on binary traits. Our original approach therefore off ers an important fi rst step for comparing the strength and, hence, the relative importance of diff erent tradeoff s, and opens the door to a better understanding of the evolution of life history traits in free-ranging populations.},

RP = ∑[Sij(Sij-1)]/N(N-1), in which Sij is the number of couples with the ith and jth surnames respectively and N is the sum of Sij over all surname pairs. The frequency of such repeated instances is then compared with frequencies from repeated runs after randomizing the order of wives and arbitrarily pairing their names with those of husbands. In a census of Paracho, Mexico, among 757 married couples there were 2865 pairs of surnames with a mean rate of repetitions of .000176 which is 25{\%} more than random expectation. In a comparison limited to the 365 Paracho-endogamous couples, the mean rate of repetitions rises to .000303 but the random rate rises even more to .000332, and the excess of observed over random disappears. The numbers of instances of repeated marriages are greater than those of marriages between persons of the same surname, so the standard errors of RP tend to be smaller than those of marital isonymy.},

When affecting fitness-related traits such as survival or reproduction, individual heterogeneity plays a key role in population dynamics and life history evolution. However, it is only recently that properly accounting for individual heterogeneity when studying population dynamics of free-ranging populations has been made possible through the development of appropriate statistical models. We aim here to review case studies of individual heterogeneity in the context of capture–recapture models for the estimation of population size and demographic parameters with imperfect detection. First, we define what individual heterogeneity means and clarify the terminology used in the literature. Second, we review the literature and illustrate why individual heterogeneity is used in capture–recapture studies by focusing on the detection of life-history tradeoffs, including senescence. Third, we explain how to model individual heterogeneity in capture–recapture models and provide the code to fit these models (https://github.com/oliviergimenez/indhet{\_}in{\_}CRmodels). The distinction is made between situations in which heterogeneity is actually measured and situations in which part of the heterogeneity remains unobserved. Regarding the latter, we outline recent developments of random-effect models and finite-mixture models. Finally, we discuss several avenues for future research.},

Demographic, temporal, spatial, and individual heterogeneity are important factors affecting the probability of persistence of small populations. Because stochastic process are intractable analytically (Ludwig [1996]), computer simulation models are often used for estimating population viability via numerical techniques. Although demographic, spatial, and temporal stochasticity have been incorporated into some population viability models, individual heterogeneity has not been included. In this paper we include individual heterogeneity in a simulation model and examine probabilities of population persistence at different levels of heterogeneity and population size. Individual heterogeneity may increase the probability of persistence of small populations. The mechanism for the extension in persistence may be explained by natural selection. Genotypes persisting through a decline may be those that survive better under the conditions causing the decline. These individuals that survive and reproduce in the face of adverse conditions may extend the probability that a small population persists.},

abstract = {Hormones play key roles in the regulation of animal and plant life histories, particularly in the timing of transitions between prematurational stages and in the scheduling of reproduction. Furthermore, hormonal mechanisms are subject to information about the external and internal environment of the the individual. Within an evolutionary radiation, the same hormone subsets often regulate the schedules of development as well as adult reproduction and related activities end, moreover, are involved in mechanisms of senescence. We propose that the pleiotropic and epistatic effects from hormonal and neural mechanisms are an important substratum for life history evolution. This analysis of hormonal mechanisms in senescence implicates a role for antagonistic pleiotropy in selection for particular subsets of hormonal mechanisms that can be traced throughout prematurational and postmaturational stages. In the example of the vertebrate MHC (major histocompatibility complex), polymorphic loci have been assembled with pleiotropic actions on several regulatory axes affecting reproduction and other fitness components. We argue that the MHC and other complex loci may be considered as life history gene complexes, with pleiotropic influences throughout the lifespan. While analyses of this kind might suggest that life histories could be evolutionarily rigid in our interpretation the population genetics that is involved Provides a theoretical basis for great flexibility in hormonal regulation during life history evolution. It is possible that life history evolution among taxonomic groups may sometimes be chaotic, which would frustrate strong inferences by the comparative method in the study of life histories between taxonomic groups.},

abstract = {Understanding how traits are integrated at the organismal level remains a fundamental problem at the interface of developmental and evolutionary biology. Hormones, regulatory signaling molecules that coordinate multiple developmental and physiological processes, are major determinants underlying phenotypic integration. The probably best example for this is the lipid-like juvenile hormone (JH) in insects. Here we review the manifold effects of JH, the most versatile animal hormone, with an emphasis on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, an organism amenable to both genetics and endocrinology. JH affects a remarkable number of processes and traits in Drosophila development and life history, including metamorphosis, behavior, reproduction, diapause, stress resistance and aging. While many molecular details underlying JH signaling remain unknown, we argue that studying "hormonal pleiotropy" offers intriguing insights into phenotypic integration and the mechanisms underlying life history evolution. In particular, we illustrate the role of JH as a key mediator of life history trade-offs.},

abstract = {The interplay of ecology and evolution has been a rich area of research for decades. A surge of interest in this area was catalyzed by the observation that evolution by natural selection can operate at the same contemporary timescales as ecological dynamics. Specifically, recent eco-evolutionary research focuses on how rapid adaptation influences ecology, and vice versa. Evolution by non-adaptive forces also occurs quickly, with ecological consequences, but understanding the full scope of ecology–evolution (eco–evo) interactions requires explicitly addressing population-level processes – genetic and demographic. We show the strong ecological effects of non-adaptive evolutionary forces and, more broadly, the value of population-level research for gaining a mechanistic understanding of eco–evo interactions. The breadth of eco-evolutionary research should expand to incorporate the breadth of evolution itself.},

abstract = {Understanding how the natural world will be impacted by environmental change over the coming decades is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity. Addressing this challenge is dif- ficult because environmental change can generate both population- level plastic and evolutionary responses, with plastic responses being either adaptive or nonadaptive. We develop an approach that links quantitative genetic theory with data-driven structured models to al- low prediction of population responses to environmental change via plasticity and adaptive evolution. After introducing general new the- ory, we construct a number of example models to demonstrate that evolutionary responses to environmental change over the short-term will be considerably slower than plastic responses and that the rate of adaptive evolution to a new environment depends on whether plastic responses are adaptive or nonadaptive. Parameterization of themod- els we develop requires information on genetic and phenotypic varia- tion and demography that will not always be available, meaning that simpler models will often be required to predict responses to envi- ronmental change. We consequently develop a method to examine whether the fullmachinery of the evolutionarily explicit models we de- velop will be needed to predict responses to environmental change or whether simpler nonevolutionary models that are now widely con- structed may be sufficient},

abstract = {A population's effective size (Ne ) is a key parameter that shapes rates of inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity, thereby influencing evolutionary processes and population viability. However, estimating Ne , and identifying key demographic mechanisms that underlie the Ne to census population size (N) ratio, remains challenging, especially for small populations with overlapping generations and substantial environmental and demographic stochasticity and hence dynamic age-structure. A sophisticated demographic method of estimating Ne /N, which uses Fisher's reproductive value to account for dynamic age-structure, has been formulated. However, this method requires detailed individual- and population-level data on sex- and age-specific reproduction and survival, and has rarely been implemented. Here, we use the reproductive value method and detailed demographic data to estimate Ne /N for a small and apparently isolated red-billed chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) population of high conservation concern. We additionally calculated two single-sample molecular genetic estimates of Ne to corroborate the demographic estimate and examine evidence for unobserved immigration and gene flow. The demographic estimate of Ne /N was 0.21, reflecting a high total demographic variance ($\sigma$2dg) of 0.71. Females and males made similar overall contributions to $\sigma$2dg. However, contributions varied among sex-age classes, with greater contributions from 3 year-old females than males, but greater contributions from ≥5 year-old males than females. The demographic estimate of Ne was {\~{}}30, suggesting that rates of increase of inbreeding and loss of genetic variation per generation will be relatively high. Molecular genetic estimates of Ne computed from linkage disequilibrium and approximate Bayesian computation were approximately 50 and 30, respectively, providing no evidence of substantial unobserved immigration which could bias demographic estimates of Ne . Our analyses identify key sex-age classes contributing to demographic variance and thus decreasing Ne /N in a small age-structured population inhabiting a variable environment. They thereby demonstrate how assessments of Ne can incorporate stochastic sex- and age-specific demography and elucidate key demographic processes affecting a population's evolutionary trajectory and viability. Furthermore, our analyses show that Ne for the focal chough population is critically small, implying that management to re-establish genetic connectivity may be required to ensure population viability.},

@article{Chevin2017,
abstract = {AbstractMany natural populations exhibit temporal fluctuations in abundance that are consistent with external forcing by a randomly changing environment. As fitness emerges from an interaction between the phenotype and the environment, such demographic fluctuations probably include a substantial contribution from fluctuating phenotypic selection. We study the stochastic population dynamics of a population exposed to random (plus possibly directional) changes in the optimum phenotype for a quantitative trait that evolves in response to this moving optimum. We derive simple analytical predictions for the distribution of log population size over time both transiently and at stationarity under Gompertz density regulation. These predictions are well matched by population- and individual-based simulations. The log population size is approximately reverse gamma distributed, with a negative skew causing an excess of low relative to high population sizes, thus increasing extinction risk relative to a symmetric (e.g., normal) distribution with the same mean and variance. Our analysis reveals how the mean and variance of log population size change with the variance and autocorrelation of deviations of the evolving mean phenotype from the optimum. We apply our results to the analysis of evolutionary rescue in a stochastic environment and show that random fluctuations in the optimum can substantially increase extinction risk by both reducing the expected growth rate and increasing the variance of population size by several orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {Identifying what drives individual heterogeneity has been of long interest to ecologists, evolutionary biologists and biodemographers, because only such identification provides deeper understanding of ecological and evolutionary population dynamics. In natural populations one is challenged to accurately decompose the drivers of heterogeneity among individuals as genetically fixed or selectively neutral. Rather than working on wild populations we present here data from a simple bacterial system in the lab, Escherichia coli. Our system, based on cutting-edge microfluidic techniques, provides high control over the genotype and the environment. It therefore allows to unambiguously decompose and quantify fixed genetic variability and dynamic stochastic variability among individuals. We show that within clonal individual variability (dynamic heterogeneity) in lifespan and lifetime reproduction is dominating at about 82-88{\%}, over the 12-18{\%} genetically (adaptive fixed) driven differences. The genetic differences among the clonal strains still lead to substantial variability in population growth rates (fitness), but, as well understood based on foundational work in population genetics, the within strain neutral variability slows adaptive change, by enhancing genetic drift, and lowering overall population growth. We also revealed a surprising diversity in senescence patterns among the clonal strains, which indicates diverse underlying cell-intrinsic processes that shape these demographic patterns. Such diversity is surprising since all cells belong to the same bacteria species, E. coli, and still exhibit patterns such as classical senescence, non-senescence, or negative senescence. We end by discussing whether similar levels of non-genetic variability might be detected in other systems and close by stating the open questions how such heterogeneity is maintained, how it has evolved, and whether it is adaptive.},

abstract = {Population fluctuations can be affected by both extrinsic (e.g. weather patterns, food availability) and intrinsic (e.g. life-history) factors. A key life-history tradeoff is the production of offspring size versus number, ranging from many small offspring to few large offspring. Models show that this life-history tradeoff in offspring size and number, through maturation time, can have significant impacts on population dynamics. However, few manipulative experiments have been conducted that can isolate life-history effects from impacts of extrinsic factors in consumer-resource systems. We experimentally tested the effect of an offspring size-number tradeoff on population stability and food availability in a consumer-resource system. Using Daphnia pulex, we created a shift from many, small offspring being produced to fewer, larger offspring. Two sets of experiments were performed to examine the interaction of an extrinsic factor (light levels) and intrinsic population structure on dynamics, and we controlled for the ingestion pressure on algal prey at the time of the manipulation. We predicted that the tradeoff would impact internal consumer population characteristics, including biasing the stage structure towards adults, increasing adult size, and increasing average population-level reproduction. This adult-dominated stage structure was predicted to then lead to instability and a low quantity-high quality food state. Under all light levels, the manipulated populations became dominated by large adults. Contrary to predictions, the amplitudes of fluctuations in Daphnia biomass were lower in populations shifted to few–large offspring, representing higher stability in these populations. Furthermore, in high light conditions, a stable low Daphnia – high algae biomass (low food quality) state was observed in few–large offspring treatments but not in control (many–small offspring) treatments. Our results show a strong link between light levels as an extrinsic factor and the life-history tradeoff of consumer offspring size versus number that impacts consumer–resource population dynamics through feedbacks with resource quality.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The highly pathogenic H5N1 is a major avian pathogen that intensively affects the poultry industry in Egypt even in spite of the adoption of vaccination strategy. Antigenic drift is among the strategies the influenza virus uses to escape the immune system that might develop due to the pressure of extensive vaccination. H5N1 mutates in an intensified manner and is considered a potential candidate for the possible next pandemic with all the catastrophic consequences such an eventuality will entail. METHODS: H5N1 was isolated from the pooled organ samples of four different affected flocks in specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs (SPF-ECE). A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to the haemagglutingin and neuraminidase. Sequencing of the full length haemagglutingin was performed. Sequence analyses of the isolated strains were performed and compared to all available H5N1 from Egyptian human and avian strains in the flu data base. Changes in the different amino acid that may be related to virus virulence, receptor affinity and epitope configuration were assigned and matched with all available Egyptian strains in the flu database. RESULTS: One out of the four strains was found to be related to the B2 Egyptian lineage, 2 were related to A1 lineage and the 4th was related to A2 lineage. Comparing data obtained from the current study by other available Egyptian H5N1 sequences remarkably demonstrate that amino acid changes in the immune escape variants are remarkably restricted to a limited number of locations on the HA molecule during antigenic drift. Molecular diversity in the HA gene, in relevance to different epitopes, were not found to follow a regular trend, suggesting abrupt cumulative sequence mutations. However a number of amino acids were found to be subjected to high mutation pressure. CONCLUSION: The current data provides a comprehensive view of HA gene evolution among H5N1 subtype viruses in Egypt. Egyptian H5N1-AIVs are constantly undergoing genetic changes and reveal a complex pattern of drifts. These findings raise the concerns about the value of using influenza vaccines in correlation with the development of antigenic drift in influenza epidemics.},

abstract = {We present a demographic model that describes the feedbacks between food supply, human mortality and fertility rates, and labor availability in expanding populations, where arable land area is not limiting. This model provides a quantitative framework to describe how environment, technology, and culture interact to influence the fates of preindustrial agricultural populations. We present equilibrium conditions and derive approximations for the equilibrium population growth rate, food availability, and other food-dependent measures of population well-being. We examine how the approximations respond to environmental changes and to human choices, and find that the impact of environmental quality depends upon whether it manifests through agricultural yield or maximum (food-independent) survival rates. Human choices can complement or offset environmental effects: greater labor investments increase both population growth and well-being, and therefore can counteract lower agricultural yield, while fertility control decreases the growth rate but can increase or decrease well-being. Finally we establish equilibrium stability criteria, and argue that the potential for loss of local stability at low population growth rates could have important consequences for populations that suffer significant environmental or demographic shocks.

abstract = {Beyond survival estimation: mark–recapture, matrix population models, and population dynamics.— Survival probability is of interest primarily as a component of population dynamics. Only when survival estimates are included in a demographic model are their population implications apparent. Survival describes the transition between living and dead. Biologically important as this transition is, it is only one of many transitions in the life cycle. Others include transitions between immature and mature, unmated and mated, breeding and non– breeding, larva and adult, small and large, and location x and location y. The demographic consequences of these transitions can be captured by matrix population models, and such models provide a natural link connecting multi–stage mark–recapture methods and population dynamics. This paper explores some of those connections, with examples taken from an ongoing analysis of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). Formulating problems in terms of a matrix population model provides an easy way to compute the likelihood of capture histories. It extends the list of demographic parameters for which maximum likelihood estimates can be obtained to include population growth rate, the sensitivity and elasticity of population growth rate, the net reproductive rate, generation time, measures of transient dynamics. In the future, multi–stage mark–recapture methods, linked to matrix population models, will become an increasingly important part of demography.},

abstract = {We assessed the extent to which traits related to ejaculate investment have evolved in lines of Drosophila melanogaster that had an evolutionary history of maintenance at biased sex ratios. Measures of ejaculate investment were made in males that had been maintained at male-biased (MB) and female-biased (FB) adult sex ratios, in which levels of sperm competition were high and low, respectively. Theory predicts that when the risk of sperm competition is high and mating opportunities are rare (as they are for males in the MB populations), males should increase investment in their few matings. We therefore predicted that males from the MB lines would (1) exhibit increased investment in their first mating opportunities and (2) deplete their ejaculates at a faster rate when mating multiply, in comparison to FB males. To investigate these predictions we measured the single mating productivity of males from three replicates each of MB and FB lines mated to five wild-type virgin females in succession. In contrast to the first prediction, there was no evidence for differences in productivity between MB and FB line males in their first matings. The second prediction was upheld: mates of MB and FB males suffered increasingly reduced productivity with successive matings, but the decline was significantly more pronounced for MB than for FB males. There was a significant reduction in the size of the accessory glands and testes of males from the MB and FB regimes after five successive matings. However, the accessory glands, but not testes, of MB males became depleted at a significantly faster rate than those of FB males. The results show that male reproductive traits evolved in response to the level of sperm competition and suggest that the ability to maintain fertility over successive matings is associated with the rate of ejaculate, and particularly accessory gland, depletion.},

abstract = {We begin by providing an operational definition of sexual conflict that applies to both inter- and intralocus conflict. Using this definition, we examine a series of simple coevolutionary models to elucidate fruitful approaches for detecting interlocus sexual conflict and resultant sexually antagonistic coevolution. We then use published empirical examples to illustrate the utility of these approaches. Three relevant attributes emerge. First, the dynamics of sexually antagonistic coevolution may obscure the conflict itself. Second, competing models of inter-sexual coevolution may yield similar population patterns near equilibria. Third, a variety of evolutionary forces underlying competing models may be acting simultaneously near equilibria. One main conclusion is that studies of emergent patterns in extant populations (e.g. studies of population and/or female fitness) are unlikely to allow us to distinguish among competing coevolutionary models. Instead, we need more research aimed at identifying the forces of selection acting on shared traits and sexually antagonistic traits. More specifically, we need a greater number of functional studies of female traits as well as studies of the consequences of both male and female traits for female fitness. A mix of selection and manipulative studies on these is likely the most promising route.},

abstract = {Understanding how the ageing process is regulated is a fascinating and fundamental problem in biology. Here we demonstrate that signals from the reproductive system influence the lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. If the cells that give rise to the germ line are killed with a laser microbeam, the lifespan of the animal is extended. Our findings suggest that germline signals act by modulating the activity of an insulin/IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor) pathway that is known to regulate the ageing of this organism. Mutants with reduced activity of the insulin/IGF-1-receptor homologue DAF-2 have been shown to live twice as long as normal, and their longevity requires the activity of DAF- 16, a member of the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcriptional regulators. We find that, in order for germline ablation to extend lifespan, DAF-16 is required, as well as a putative nuclear hormone receptor, DAF-12. In addition, our findings suggest that signals from the somatic gonad also influence ageing, and that this effect requires DAF-2 activity. Together, our findings imply that the C. elegans insulin/IGF-1 system integrates multiple signals to define the animal's rate of ageing. This study demonstrates an inherent relationship between the reproductive state of this animal and its lifespan, and may have implications for the co-evolution of reproductive capability and longevity.},

abstract = {Ants and other social insects forming large societies are generally characterized by marked reproductive division of labour. Queens largely monopolize reproduction whereas workers have little reproductive potential. In addition, some social insect species show tremendous lifespan differences between the queen and worker caste. Remarkably, queens and workers are usually genotypically identical, meaning that any phenotypic differences between the two castes arise from caste-specific gene expression. Using a combination of differential display, microarrays and reverse Northern blots, we found 16 genes that were differentially expressed between adult queens and workers in the ant Lasius niger, a species with highly pronounced reproductive division of labour and a several-fold lifespan difference between queens and workers. RNA ligase mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) and gene walking were used to further characterize these genes. On the basis of the molecular function of their nearest homologues, three genes appear to be involved in reproductive division of labour. Another three genes, which were exclusively overexpressed in queens, are possibly involved in the maintenance and repair of the soma, a candidate mechanism for lifespan determination. In-depth functional analyses of these genes are now needed to reveal their exact role.},

Evolutionary hypotheses propose that ageing evolves as the necessary cost of processes increasing early reproductive success1,2 , or because of weaker selection against late-acting mutations3 . A prediction of these hypotheses is that the rate of ageing shouldincreaseandthe average lifespan decrease as the rate of extrinsic mortality increases1–7 . Alternatively, non-adaptive, purely mechanistic hypotheses invoke damage to DNA, cells, tissues and organs as being the unique cause of senescence and ineluctable death of organisms . Here we show that the evolution of eusociality is associated with a 100-fold increase in insect lifespan. Such an increase is predicted by evolutionary theories because termite, bee and ant queens live in colonies that are sheltered and heavily defended against predators. Moreover, a comparison of ants with contrasting life histories also reveals an association between lifespan and extrinsic rate of mortality. These results provide strong support for evolutionary theories of ageing, as purely mechanistic hypotheses of senescence do not propose any association between the rate of extrinsic mortality and lifespans.},

abstract = {Dietary restriction extends healthy lifespan in diverse organisms and reduces fecundity(1,2). It is widely assumed to induce adaptive reallocation of nutrients from reproduction to somatic maintenance, aiding survival of food shortages in nature(3-6). If this were the case, long life under dietary restriction and high fecundity under full feeding would be mutually exclusive, through competition for the same limiting nutrients. Here we report a test of this idea in which we identified the nutrients producing the responses of lifespan and fecundity to dietary restriction in Drosophila. Adding essential amino acids to the dietary restriction condition increased fecundity and decreased lifespan, similar to the effects of full feeding, with other nutrients having little or no effect. However, methionine alone was necessary and sufficient to increase fecundity as much as did full feeding, but without reducing lifespan. Reallocation of nutrients therefore does not explain the responses to dietary restriction. Lifespan was decreased by the addition of amino acids, with an interaction between methionine and other essential amino acids having a key role. Hence, an imbalance in dietary amino acids away from the ratio optimal for reproduction shortens lifespan during full feeding and limits fecundity during dietary restriction. Reduced activity of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway extends lifespan in diverse organisms(7), and we find that it also protects against the shortening of lifespan with full feeding. In other organisms, including mammals, it may be possible to obtain the benefits to lifespan of dietary restriction without incurring a reduction in fecundity, through a suitable balance of nutrients in the diet.},

Although genotypes exist and are inherited in a discrete space convenient for many sorts of analyses, the causation of key phenomena such as natural selection and disease takes place in a continuous phenotype space whose relationship to the genotype space is only dimly grasped. Direct study of genotypes with minimal reference to phenotypes is clearly insufficient to elucidate these phenomena. Phenomics, the comprehensive study of phenotypes, is therefore essential to understanding biology. For all of the advances in knowledge that a genomic approach to biology has brought, awareness is growing that many phenotypes are highly polygenic and susceptible to genetic interactions. Prime examples are common human diseases. Phenomic thinking is starting to take hold and yield results that reveal why it is so critical. The dimensionality of phenotypic data are often extremely high, suggesting that attempts to characterize phenotypes with a few key measurements are unlikely to be completely successful. However, once phenotypic data are obtained, causation can turn out to be unexpectedly simple. Phenotypic data can be informative about the past history of selection and unexpectedly predictive of long-term evolution. Comprehensive efforts to increase the throughput and range of phenotyping are an urgent priority.},

The advent of evo-devo first and of the genomic era later would seem to have superseded talk of transitions in phenotypic space and the like, central to Alberch's approach. On the contrary, this paper shows that recent empirical and theoretical advances have only sharpened the need for a different conceptual treatment of how phenotypes are produced. Old-fashioned metaphors like genetic blueprint and genetic programme are not only woefully inadequate but positively misleading about the nature of G--{\textgreater}P, and are being replaced by an algorithmic approach emerging from the study of a variety of actual G--{\textgreater}P maps. These include RNA folding, protein function and the study of evolvable software. Some generalities are emerging from these disparate fields of analysis, and I suggest that the concept of 'developmental encoding' (as opposed to the classical one of genetic encoding) provides a promising computational-theoretical underpinning to coherently integrate ideas on evolvability, modularity and robustness and foster a fruitful framing of the G--{\textgreater}P mapping problem.},

abstract = {Quantitative genetics is at or is fast approaching its centennial. In this perspective I consider five current issues pertinent to the application of quantitative genetics to evolutionary theory. First, I discuss the utility of a quantitative genetic perspective in describing genetic variation at two very different levels of resolution, (1) in natural, free-ranging populations and (2) to describe variation at the level of DNA transcription. Whereas quantitative genetics can serve as a very useful descriptor of genetic variation, its greater usefulness is in predicting evolutionary change, particularly when used in the first instance (wild populations). Second, I review the contributions of Quantitative trait loci (QLT) analysis in determining the number of loci and distribution of their genetic effects, the possible importance of identifying specific genes, and the ability of the multivariate breeder's equation to predict the results of bivariate selection experiments. QLT analyses appear to indicate that genetic effects are skewed, that at least 20 loci are generally involved, with an unknown number of alleles, and that a few loci have major effects. However, epistatic effects are common, which means that such loci might not have population-wide major effects: this question waits upon (QTL) analyses conducted on more than a few inbred lines. Third, I examine the importance of research into the action of specific genes on traits. Although great progress has been made in identifying specific genes contributing to trait variation, the high level of gene interactions underlying quantitative traits makes it unlikely that in the near future we will have mechanistic models for such traits, or that these would have greater predictive power than quantitative genetic models. In the fourth section I present evidence that the results of bivariate selection experiments when selection is antagonistic to the genetic covariance are frequently not well predicted by the multivariate breeder's equation. Bivariate experiments that combine both selection and functional analyses are urgently needed. Finally, I discuss the importance of gaining more insight, both theoretical and empirical, on the evolution of the G and P matrices.},

abstract = {The placing of animal behaviour in an evolutionary context is one of the great achievements of biologists in the last century. Life history theory has been a powerful tool in explaining both adaptation and constraint in phenotypic evolution, but rarely addresses the mechanistic bases of the traits it discusses. Recent advances in molecular biology have begun to uncover these mechanisms, and provide a challenge to the traditional view that life history trade-offs are the result of the differential allocation of limiting resources. In particular, costs of reproduction in Caenorhabditis elegans appear to arise from molecular signals, which have been claimed to be arbitrary with respect to fitness. We review the evidence that costs of reproduction in C. elegans are not resource based, and find that this is not necessarily the case. However, we welcome the challenge to traditional thinking, and suggest that integrating an understanding of mechanisms into life history theory will be one of the most exciting tasks facing evolutionary biologists in the 21st century. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Although the existence of trade-offs has been clearly demonstrated, the 'classical' mechanism of adaptive resource allocation that should underlie them has recently received criticism. In this study, we explore the molecular mechanisms of life-history trade-offs by applying a quantitative genomic approach. Analysis of global gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster revealed 34 genes whose expression coincided with the genetic trade-off between larval survival and adult size. The joint expression of these candidate 'trade-off' genes explained 86.3{\%} of the trade-off. Fourteen of these genes have known functions which suggest that the larval survival-adult size trade-off could be the result of resource allocation at the organismal level, but at the level of cellular metabolism the trade-off would reduce to a shift between energy metabolism versus protein biosynthesis, regulated by the RAS signalling pathway.},

We investigate principal drivers of variability in se- quence of stages during an individual's life in a stage-structured popu- lation.Wequantify heterogeneity bymeasuring population entropy of a Markov chain, which computes the rate of diversification of individual life courses. Using individual data of a primate population, weshowthat density regulates the stage composition of the population but that its entropy and the generating moments of heterogeneity are independent of density. This lack of influence of density on heterogeneity is due to neither low year-to-year variation in entropy nor differences in survival among stages but is rather due to differences in stage transitions. Our analysis thus shows that well-known classical ecological selective forces, such as density regulation, are not linked to potential selective forces governing heterogeneity through underlying stage dynamics. Despite evolution acting heavily on individual variability in fitness components, our understanding is poor whether observed heterogeneity is adaptive and how it evolves and is maintained. Our analysis illustrates how en- tropy represents amore integrated measure of diversity compared to the population structural composition, giving us new insights about the un- derlying drivers of individual heterogeneity within populations and po- tential evolutionary mechanisms.},

@article{Hayward2015a,
abstract = {The authors regret to report a miscalculation of two of the twenty traits analysed in this paper, namely Home Range Size (HRS) and Home Range Quality (HRQ). The methods used to calculate the new values were the same as the original paper (Hayward et al., 2015), while the error arose as a result of misalignment of the grids used for the census data (on which is based sheep location) and vegetation cover (on which is based the quality of the habitat). Having re-aligned the grids and recalculated both HRS and HRQ, we repeated all the analyses from the original manuscript. First, we used generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) to determine the pattern of age-specific change in both traits. As in the original paper, the best-supported model suggested that the age-specific change differed between the sexes for both HRS ($\Delta$AIC relative to a model with no sex interaction = − 11.13) and HRQ ($\Delta$AIC = − 28.83). As expected, home range size shows the same age-specific pattern as before, with HRS increasing with age in males but declining in females (Fig. 1). However, in contrast to the original results, HRQ increased with age in females and remained constant with age in males, until declining sharply in the oldest age category (Fig. 1). Second, we applied generalized additive models (GAMs) to test for variation in ageing trajectories among all of the twenty traits we analysed. We re-ran all of the models from the original paper and once again found that the best-supported model suggested that all traits followed a different ageing trajectory ($\Delta$AIC relative to the next best model, which fitted different ageing trajectories to the different traits, but fitted the same trajectory to the same trait in either sex = − 96.59). GAM estimates supported the same ageing patterns as the GLMMs above (Fig. 2). Overall, our new results provide the same conclusion as the original paper: ageing trajectories vary widely between traits, highlighting the complexity of ageing in natural populations and questioning the hypothesis that fitness related-traits should senesce in a synchronous manner. Our new results suggest that a decline in home range size with age in females is compensated for by an increase in home range quality, while the opposite is true for males. More detailed analyses in the future will be able to determine the causes and consequences of variation in senescence in home range sizes. The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.},

Overall, 95 {\%} of fertility was completed before 50, and 95 {\%} of mortality experienced by age 65, with a mean life expectancy of 41 years for females who survived to the min- imum age at first birth (9 years). Elephant females have a relatively long period (c. 16 years) of viability after 95 {\%} completed fertility, although reproduction does not entirely cease until they are over 65. We found no evidence of in- creased investment among females aged over 40 in terms of delay to next birth or calf mortality.

abstract = {1.Biologists are increasingly interested in decomposing trait dynamics into underlying processes, such as evolution, plasticity and demography. Four important frameworks that allow for such a decomposition are the quantitative genetic animal model (AM), the ‘Geber' method (GM), the age-structured Price equation (APE), and the integral projection model (IPM). However, as these frameworks have largely been developed independently, they differ in the assumptions they make, the data they require, as well as their outcomes and interpretation.2.Here we evaluate how each framework decomposes trait dynamics into underlying processes. To do so, we apply them to simulated data for a hypothetical animal population. Individual body size was affected by, among others, genes, maternal effects and food intake. We simulated scenarios with and without selection on body size, and with high and low heritability.3.The APE and IPM provided similar results, as did the AM and GM, with important differences between the former and the latter. All frameworks detected positive contributions of selection in the high but not in the low selection scenarios. However, only the AM and GM distinguished between the high and low heritability scenarios. Furthermore, the AM and GM revealed a high contribution of plasticity. The APE and IPM attributed most of the change in body size to ontogenetic growth and inheritance, where the latter captures the combined effects of plasticity, maternal effects and heritability. We show how these apparent discrepancies are mostly due to differences in aims and definitions. For example, the APE and IPM capture selection, whereas the AM and GM focus on the response to selection. Furthermore, the frameworks differ in the processes that are ascribed to plasticity and in how they take into account demography.4.We conclude that no single framework provides the ‘true' contributions of evolution, plasticity and demography. Instead, different research questions require different frameworks. A thorough understanding of the different definitions of their components is necessary for selecting the most appropriate framework for the question at hand, and for making biologically meaningful inferences. This work thus supports both future analysis as well as the careful interpretation of existing work.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Advancing this debate requires careful consideration of differences among inference approaches used by proponents of each hypothesis.

abstract = {Individual quality has been measured as a variety of different traits and in several different contexts. However, the implications of such measurements in terms of overall fitness are less straightforward than has generally been appreciated. Here we outline some key issues in this regard that have yet to be addressed. Specifically, we consider the importance of both variation in selection on individual and multivariate suites of traits, and of context-specific plasticity in allocation strategies. We argue that an explicit life-history perspective is crucial for understanding variation in quality, as both the strength and direction of selection and an individual's response to it can vary within a breeding season. Hence, 'quality' is not a static characteristic that can be measured by taking longitudinal measures of single traits across a population, but rather a dynamic, multivariate suite of traits that is dependent not only on the selective context, but also on the nature and intensity of selection operating at any given time. We highlight these points by considering recent research on selection and plasticity.},

abstract = {We analyze weak fluctuating selection on a quantitative character in an age-structured population not subject to density regulation. We assume that early in the first year of life before selection, during a critical state of development, environments exert a plastic effect on the phenotype, which remains constant throughout the life of an individual. Age-specific selection on the character affects survival and fecundity, which have intermediate optima subject to temporal environmental fluctuations with directional selection in some age classes as special cases. Weighting individuals by their reproductive value, as suggested by Fisher, we show that the expected response per year in the weighted mean character has the same form as for models with no age structure. Environmental stochasticity generates stochastic fluctuations in the weighted mean character following a first-order autoregressive model with a temporally autocorrelated noise term and stationary variance depending on the amount of phenotypic plasticity. The parameters of the process are simple weighted averages of parameters used to describe age-specific survival and fecundity. The "age-specific selective weights" are related to the stable distribution of reproductive values among age classes. This allows partitioning of the change in the weighted mean character into age-specific components.},

abstract = {Individual heterogeneity in life history shapes eco-evolutionary processes, and unobserved heterogeneity can affect demographic outputs characterising life history and population dynamical properties. Demographic frameworks like matrix models or integral projection models represent powerful approaches to disentangle mechanisms linking individual life histories and population-level processes. Recent developments have provided important steps towards their application to study eco-evolutionary dynamics, but so far individual heterogeneity has largely been ignored. Here, we present a general demographic framework that incorporates individual heterogeneity in a flexible way, by separating static and dynamic traits (discrete or continuous). First, we apply the framework to derive the consequences of ignoring heterogeneity for a range of widely used demographic outputs. A general conclusion is that besides the long-term growth rate lambda, all parameters can be affected. Second, we discuss how the framework can help advance current demographic models of eco-evolutionary dynamics, by incorporating individual heterogeneity. For both applications numerical examples are provided, including an empirical example for pike. For instance, we demonstrate that predicted demographic responses to climate warming can be reversed by increased heritability. We discuss how applications of this demographic framework incorporating individual heterogeneity can help answer key biological questions that require a detailed understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

The vast majority of IPMs have been based on only one trait (usually  size), but there are also some studies including more than one (see  table 1 in rees2014, and the table in our paper).  We did not  develop any new methods, but rather just point out the general  distinction between static and dynamic traits, and the importance of  this for eco-evolutionary models and heterogeneity.

I think the answer is yes - it does yield a multitrait matrix.

abstract = {The development of stochastic demography has largely been based on age structured populations, although other types of demographic structure, especially permanent and dynamic heterogeneity, are likely common in natural populations. The combination of stochasticity and demographic structure is a challenge for analyses of population dynamics and extinction risk, because the population structure will fluctuate around the stable structure and the population size shows transient fluctuations. However, by using a diffusion approximation for the total reproductive value, density-independent dynamics of structured populations can be described with only three population parameters: the expected population growth rate, the environmental variance and the demographic variance. These parameters depend on population structure via the state-specific vital rates and transition rates. Once they are found, the diffusion approximation represents a substantial reduction in model complexity.Here, we review and compare the key population parameters across a wide range of demographic structure, from the case of no structure to the most general case of dynamic heterogeneity, and for both discrete and continuous types. We focus on the demographic variance, but also show how environmental stochasticity can be included. This study brings together results from recent models, each considering a specific type of population structure, and places them in a general framework for structured populations. Comparison across different types of demographic structure reveals that the reproductive value is an essential concept for understanding how population structure affects stochastic dynamics and extinction risk. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Matrix population models are widely used to study population dynamics but have been criticized because their outputs are sensitive to the dimension of the matrix (or, equivalently, to the class width). This sensitivity is concerning for the population growth rate ($\lambda$) because this is an intrinsic characteristic of the population that should not depend on the model specification. It has been suggested that the sensitivity of $\lambda$ to matrix dimension was linked to the existence of fast pathways (i.e. the fraction of individuals that systematically move up a class), whose proportion increases when class width increases. We showed that for matrix population models with growth transition only from class i to class i + 1, $\lambda$ was independent of the class width when the mortality and the recruitment rates were constant, irrespective of the growth rate. We also showed that if there were indeed fast pathways, there were also in about the same proportion slow pathways (i.e. the fraction of individuals that systematically remained in the same class), and that they jointly act as a diffusion process (where diffusion here is the movement in size of an individual whose size increments are random according to a normal distribution with mean zero). For 53 tree species from a tropical rain forest in the Central African Republic, the diffusion resulting from common matrix dimensions was much stronger than would be realistic. Yet, the sensitivity of $\lambda$ to matrix dimension for a class width in the range 1-10 cm was small, much smaller than the sampling uncertainty on the value of $\lambda$. Moreover, $\lambda$ could either increase or decrease when class width increased depending on the species. Overall, even if the class width should be kept small enough to limit diffusion, it had little impact on the estimate of $\lambda$ for tree species.},

We present a general framework for demographic models which incorporates the effects of history on population dynamics. The framework incorporates prior condition into the i-state variable and includes an algorithm for constructing the population projection matrix from information on current state dynamics as a function of prior condition. Three biologically motivated classes of prior condition are included: prior stages, linear functions of current and prior stages, and equivalence classes of prior stages. Taking advantage of the matrix formulation of the model, we show how to calculate sensitivity and elasticity of any demographic outcome. Prior condition effects are a source of inter-individual variation in vital rates, i.e., individual heterogeneity. As an example, we construct and analyze a second-order model of Lathyrus vernus, a long-lived herb. We present population growth rate, the stable population distribution, the reproductive value vector, and the elasticity of $\lambda$ to changes in the second-order transition rates. We quantify the contribution of prior conditions to the total heterogeneity in the stable population of Lathyrus using the entropy of the stable distribution.},

Under the additional assumption of small mutations, we derive an age-dependent ordinary differential equation that extends the Canonical Equation. These evolutionary approximations have never been introduced to our knowledge. They are based on ecological phenomena represented by PDEs that generalize the Gurtin-McCamy equation in Demography. Another particularity is that they involve a fitness function, describing the probability of invasion of the resident population by the mutant one, that can not always be computed explicitly. Examples illustrate how adding an age-structure enrich the modelling of structured population by including life history features such as senescence. In the cases considered, we establish the evolutionary approximations and study their long time behavior and the nature of their evolutionary singularities when computation is tractable.

Using the stationary distribution of the population's trait variance, we identify three qualitatively different sub-domains of "stochastic branching" and illustrate our results using a model of social evolution. We find that in very small populations, branching will almost never be observed; in intermediate populations, branching is intermittent, arising and disappearing over time; in larger populations, finally, branching is expected to occur and persist for substantial periods of time. Our study provides a clearer picture of the ecological conditions that facilitate the appearance and persistence of novel evolutionary lineages in the face of genetic drift.},

Here, we investigate the evolution of social behavior in structured populations under arbitrary mutation probabilities. We consider populations of fixed size N, structured such that in the absence of selection, all individuals have the same probability of reproducing or dying (neutral reproductive values are the all same). Two types of individuals, A and B, corresponding to two types of social behavior, are competing; the fidelity of strategy transmission from parent to offspring is tuned by a parameter $\mu$. Social interactions have a direct effect on individual fecundities. Under the assumption of small phenotypic differences (implying weak selection), we provide a formula for the expected frequency of type A individuals in the population, and deduce conditions for the long-term success of one strategy against another. We then illustrate our results with three common life-cycles (Wright-Fisher, Moran Birth-Death and Moran Death-Birth), and specific population structures (graph-structured populations). Qualitatively, we find that some life-cycles (Moran Birth-Death, Wright-Fisher) prevent the evolution of altruistic behavior, confirming previous results obtained with perfect strategy transmission. We also show that computing the expected frequency of altruists on a regular graph may require knowing more than just the graph's size and degree.},

I first present a simple demographic example to illustrate how spatial structure weakens selection against fitness costs. Then, I illustrate the importance of disentangling the evolution of a trait from the evolution of potential associated costs, using an example taken from a recent study investigating the effect of spatial structure on the evolution of host defense. In this example indeed, the differences between spatial and non-spatial selection gradients are due to differences in the fitness costs, thereby undermining interpretations of the results made in terms of the trait only.

This analysis reveals that the growth rate depends on (i) the geometric mean of the average growth rate in the metapopulation, (ii) whether individuals tend to be more numerous in high quality demes and (iii) temporal fluctuations in the spatial distribution of individuals. The two latter effects had been previously identified but mostly in simulation studies. Here I identify them in a unified analytical framework which helps clarifying previous studies.

This population is described by a stochastic Lotka-Volterra system, obtained as limit of renormalized interacting birth and death processes. The weak cooperation assumption allows the system not to blow up. We study the existence and uniqueness of a quasi-stationary distribution, that is convergence to equilibrium conditioned on non-extinction. To this aim we generalize in two-dimensions spectral tools developed for one-dimensional generalized Feller diffusion processes. The existence proof of a quasi-stationary distribution is reduced to the one for a d-dimensional Kolmogorov diffusion process under a symmetry assumption. The symmetry we need is satisfied under a local balance condition relying the ecological rates. A novelty is the outlined relation between the uniqueness of the quasi-stationary distribution and the ultracontractivity of the killed semi-group. By a comparison between the killing rates for the populations of each type and the one of the global population, we show that the quasi-stationary distribution can be either supported by individuals of one (the strongest one) type or supported by individuals of the two types. We thus highlight two different long time behaviors depending on the parameters of the model: either the model exhibits an intermediary time scale for which only one type (the dominant trait) is surviving, or there is a positive probability to have coexistence of the two species.},

This density-dependence corresponds to intraspecific competition pressure, which is ubiquitous in ecology, and translates mathematically into a quadratic death rate. The logistic branching process, or LB-process, can thus be seen as (the mass of) a fragmentation process (corresponding to the branching mechanism) combined with constant coagulation rate (the death rate is proportional to the number of possible coalescing pairs). In the continuous state-space setting, the LB-process is a time-changed (in Lamperti's fashion) Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type process. We obtain similar results for both constructions: when natural deaths do not occur, the LB-process converges to a specified distribution; otherwise, it goes extinct a.s. In the latter case, we provide the expectation and the Laplace transform of the absorption time, as a functional of the solution of a Riccati differential equation. We also show that the quadratic regulatory term allows the LB-process to start at infinity, despite the fact that births occur infinitely often as the initial state goes to $\backslash$infty. This result can be viewed as an extension of the pure-death process starting from infinity associated to Kingman's coalescent, when some independent fragmentation is added.},

An important feature of the model is that population size fluctuation and regulation are intrinsic to the model rather than externally imposed. A consequence of this model is that the fluctuation in population size enhances the prospects for fixation of a beneficial mutation with constant relative viability, which is contrary to a result for the Wright-Fisher model with fluctuating population size.

abstract = {In continuous-time predator-prey models, the per capita rate of consumption (the functional response or "trophic function") is usually interpreted as a behavioral phenomenon. The classical assumptions are that predators encounter prey at random and that the trophic function depends on prey abundance only. We argue that this approach is not always appropriate. The trophic function must be considered on the slow time scale of population dynamics at which the models operate-not on the fast behavioral time scale. We propose that, in cases where these two time scales differ, it is reasonable to assume that the trophic function depends on the ratio of prey to predator abundances. Several field and laboratory observations support this hypothesis. We compare the consequences of the two types of dependence with respect to the dynamical properties of the models and the responses of population equilibria to variations in primary production. In traditional prey-dependent models, only the predator population responds to primary production, while both levels respond in ratio-dependent models. This result is generalized to food chains. We suggest that the ratio-dependent form of the trophic function is a simple way of accounting for many types of heterogeneity that occur in large scale natural systems, while the prey-dependent form may be more appropriate for homogeneous systems like chemostats. {\textcopyright} 1989 Academic Press Limited.},

abstract = {We set out to explore a class of stochastic processes called, 'adaptive dynamics', which supposedly capture some of the essentials of the long-term biological evolution. These processes have a strong deterministic component. This allows a classification of their qualitative features which in many aspects is similar to classifications from the theory of deterministic dynamical systems. But, they also display a good number of clear-cut novel dynamical phenomena. The sample functions of an adaptive dynamics are piece-wise constant function from R+ to the finite subsets of some 'trait' space X in R k. Those subsets we call 'adaptive conditions'. Both the range and the jumps of a sample function are governed by a function s, called 'fitness', mapping the present adaptive condition and the trait value of a potential 'mutant' to R. Sign(s) tell us which subsets of X qualify as adaptive conditions, which mutants can potentially 'invade', leading to a jump in the sample function, and which adaptive condition(s) can result from such invasion. Fitness supposedly satisfy certain constraints derived from their population/ community dynamical origin, such as the fact that all mutants which are equal to some 'residents', i.e., element of the present adaptive condition, have zero fitness. Apart from that, we suppose that s is as smooth as can be possibly condoned by its community dynamical origin. Moreover, we assume that a mutant can differ but little from its resident 'progenitor'. In Sections 1 and 2, we describe the biological background of our mathematical framework. In Section 1, we deal with the position of our framework relative to present and past evolutionary research. In Section 2, we discuss the community dynamical origin of s, and the reason for making a number of specific simplifications relative to the full complexity seen in nature. In Sections 3 and 4, we consider some general, mathematical, as well as biological conclusions that can be drawn from our frame work in its simplest guise, that is, when we assume that X is 1-dimensional, and that the cardinality of the adaptive conditions stays low. The main result is a classification of the adaptively singular points. These points comprise both the adaptive point attractors, as well as the points where the adaptive trajectory can branch; thus, attaining its characteristic tree-like shape. In Section 5, we discuss how adaptive dynamics relate through a limiting argument to stochastic models in which individual organisms are represented as separate entities. It is only through such a limiting procedure that any class of population or evolutionary models can eventually be justified. Our basic assumptions are : (i) clonal reproduction, i.e., the resident individuals reproduce faithfully without any of the complications of sex or Mendelian genetics, except for the occasional occurrence of a mutant, (ii) a large system size and an even rarer occurrence of mutations per birth event, (iii) uniqueness and global attractiveness of any interior attractor of the community dynamics in the limit of the infinite system size. In Section 6, we try to delineate, by a tentative listing of 'axioms', the largest possible class of processes that can result from the kind of limiting considerations spelled out in Section 5. And in Section 7, we heuristically derive some very general predictions about macro-evolutionary patterns, based on those weak assumptions only. In the final Section 8, we discuss (i) how the results from the preceding sections may fit into a more encompassing view of biological evolution, and (ii) some directions for further research.},

abstract = {Mortality is a key process in ecology and evolution, and much effort is spent on statistical and theoretical modelling of this process. Mortality hazard rates describe individuals' instantaneous ability to survive at different times, whereas survival probabilities are defined for time-intervals of a given length. We argue that it is often more informative to model and interpret time-averaged mortality hazard rates in cases where survival probabilities are traditionally used. We discuss three areas where modelling of survival probabilities may be little informative or even misleading, and where mortality hazard rates are more suited for inference; (i) modelling of covariate effects on survival probabilities versus mortality hazard rates, (ii) modelling of multiple sources of mortality and competing risks, and (iii) elasticity analyses of population growth rate with respect to survival probabilities versus mortality rates. By focusing on modelling (time-averaged) mortality hazard rates (measurements on a ratio scale), one avoids several inherent problems of comparing survival or mortality probabilities (measurements on an absolute scale). In particular, statements about relative differences between mortality hazard rates, or effects of relative changes in mortality rates on population growth (elasticities), are more informative than similar statements involving survival probabilities. The concept of hazard rates is essential for understanding ecological and evolutionary processes and we provide an intuitive explanation for this, using several examples.},

Depending on whether they are ranked by pace or by shape, species are ordered differently. 4.Alternative pace measures turn out to be highly correlated. Alternative shape measures are also highly correlated. The correlation between pace and shape ranking is negative but weak. Among the examples here, no species is long lived yet exhibits negligible ageing - contrary to the commonly held view that long-lived species are good candidates for negligible ageing. 5.Analysis of species in pace-shape space provides a tool to identify key determinants of the evolution of ageing for species across the tree of life.},

It might even occur in humans. During diapause, there is minimal cell division and greatly reduced metabolism, and development is put on hold. Yet there are no ill effects for the pregnancy when it eventually continues. Multiple factors can induce diapause, including seasonal supplies of food, temperature, photoperiod and lactation. The successful reactivation and continuation of pregnancy then requires a viable embryo, a receptive uterus and effective molecular communication between the two. But how do the blastocysts survive and remain viable during this period of time, which can be up to a year in some cases? And what are the signals that bring it out of suspended animation? Here, we provide an overview of the process of diapause and address these questions, focussing on recent molecular data.},

Members of the closely related genera Nodilittorina, Littoraria and Mainwaringia have been used as outgroups, and it appears that Littorina is monophyletic. An earlier morphological phylogeny has been revised, and its topology found to be almost entirely consistent with that from the molecular data. The fossil record is sparse, but likewise consistent. A consensus tree is presented, showing clear resolution of basal and terminal branches, and a central unresolved polychotomy. We have used fossil evidence and geological events to estimate the ages of some clades, and thus to calculate average rates of molecular evolution, which in turn provide approximate dates for all branches of the molecular phylogeny. The central polychotomy may be explained by a burst of rapid speciation in the northwestern Pacific during the Middle Miocene, perhaps driven by climatic fluctuation. Our results support the hypothesis that the two clades of Littorina in the northern Atlantic originated from Pacific ancestors which took part in the Pliocene trans-Arctic migration of marine organisms},

abstract = {A major question in ecology is how age-specific variation in demographic parameters influences population dynamics. Based on long-term studies of growing populations of birds and mammals, we analyze population dynamics by using fluctuations in the total reproductive value of the population. This enables us to account for random fluctuations in age distribution. The influence of demographic and environmental stochasticity on the population dynamics of a species decreased with generation time. Variation in age-specific contributions to total reproductive value and to stochastic components of population dynamics was correlated with the position of the species along the slow-fast continuum of life-history variation. Younger age classes relative to the generation time accounted for larger contributions to the total reproductive value and to demographic stochasticity in "slow" than in "fast" species, in which many age classes contributed more equally. In contrast, fluctuations in population growth rate attributable to stochastic environmental variation involved a larger proportion of all age classes independent of life history. Thus, changes in population growth rates can be surprisingly well explained by basic species-specific life-history characteristics.},

We suggest that these results may be very useful in practical management because they also give us the possibility of estimating the uncertainties in our estimates of for instance the probability of extinction of small populations.

The dynamics of this Markov chain is governed by two types of events: vertex duplication, where at constant rate a pair of vertices is sampled uniformly, one of these vertices loses its incident edges and is rewired to the other vertex and its neighbors; and edge removal, where each edge disappears at constant rate. Besides the number of vertices {\$}n{\$}, the model has a single parameter {\$}r{\_}n{\$}. Using a coalescent approach, we obtain explicit formulas for the first moments of several graph invariants such as the number of edges or the number of complete subgraphs of order {\$}k{\$}. These are then used to identify five non-trivial regimes depending on the asymptotics of the parameter {\$}r{\_}n{\$}. We derive an explicit expression for the degree distribution, and show that under appropriate rescaling it converges to classical distributions when the number of vertices goes to infinity. Finally, we give asymptotic bounds for the number of connected components, and show that in the sparse regime the number of edges is Poissonian.},

abstract = {Edge effects are among the most extensively studied ecological phenomena, yet we lack a general, predictive framework to understand the patterns and variability observed. We present a conceptual model, based on resource distribution, that predicts whether organismal abundances near edges are expected to increase, decrease, or remain unchanged for any species at any edge type. Predictions are based on whether resources are found predominantly in one habitat (decreased abundance in preferred habitat, increase in non-preferred), divided between habitats (predicts an increase near both edges), spread equally among habitats (predicts a neutral edge response), or concentrated along the edge (increase). There are several implications of this model that can explain much of the variability reported in the edge literature. For instance, our model predicts that a species may show positive, negative, and neutral responses, depending on the edge type encountered, which explains some intraspecific variability observed in the literature. In addition, any predictable change in resource use (for example, by region or season) may explain temporal or spatial variability in responses even for the same species at the same edge type. We offer a preliminary test of our model by making predictions for 52 bird species from three published studies of abundance responses near forest edges. Predictions are based solely on general information about each species' habitat associations and resource use. Our model correctly predicted the direction of 25 out of 29 observed edge responses, although it tended to under-predict increases and over-predict decreases. This model is important because it helps make sense of a largely descriptive literature and allows future studies to be carried out under a predictive framework.},

Genetic estimators of both NC and Ne are increasingly widely used because molecular markers are increasingly available, statistical methods are improving rapidly, and genetic estimators complement or improve upon traditional demographic estimators. We review the kinds and applications of estimators of both NC and Ne, and the often undervalued and misunderstood ratio of effective-to-census size (Ne/NC). We focus on recently improved and well evalu- ated methods that are most likely to facilitate conservation. Finally, we outline areas of future research to improve Ne and NC estimation in wild populations.},

abstract = {With an ecological-evolutionary perspective increasingly applied toward the conservation and management of endangered or exploited species, the genetic estimation of effective population size (N(e)) has proliferated. Based on a comprehensive analysis of empirical literature from the past two decades, we asked: (i) how often do studies link N(e) to the adult census population size (N)? (ii) To what extent is N(e) correctly linked to N? (iii) How readily is uncertainty accounted for in both N(e) and N when quantifying N(e)/N ratios? and (iv) how frequently and to what degree might errors in the estimation of N(e) or N affect inferences of N(e)/N ratios? We found that only 20{\%} of available N(e) estimates (508 of 2617; 233 studies) explicitly attempted to link N(e) and N; of these, only 31{\%} (160 of 508) correctly linked N(e) and N. Moreover, only 7{\%} (41 of 508) of N(e)/N ratios (correctly linked or not) reported confidence intervals for both N(e) and N; for those cases where confidence intervals were reported for N(e) only, 31{\%} of N(e)/N ratios overlapped with 1, of which more than half also reached below N(e)/N = 0.01. Uncertainty in N(e)/N ratios thus sometimes spanned at least two orders of magnitude. We conclude that the estimation of N(e)/N ratios in natural populations could be significantly improved, discuss several options for doing so, and briefly outline some future research directions.},

Some structural properties of the scientific fields - in particular their density -, which are defined independently of the phylomemy reconstruction, are clearly correlated with their status and their fate in the phylomemy (like their age or their short term survival). Within the framework of a quantitative epistemology, this approach raises the question of predictibility for science evolution, and sketches a prototypical life cycle of the scientific fields: an increase of their cohesion after their emergence, the renewal of their conceptual background through branching or merging events, before decaying when their density is getting too low.},

abstract = {The temporal method for estimating effective population size (Ne) from the standardized variance in allele frequency change (F) is presented in a generalized form. Whereas previous treatments of this method have adopted rather limiting assumptions, the present analysis shows that the temporal method is generally applicable to a wide variety of organisms. Use of a revised model of gene sampling permits a more generalized interpretation of Ne than that used by some other authors studying this method. It is shown that two sampling plans (individuals for genetic analysis taken before or after reproduction) whose differences have been stressed by previous authors can be treated in a uniform way. Computer simulations using a wide variety of initial conditions show that different formulas for computing F have much less effect on Ne than do sample size (S), number of generations between samples (t), or the number of loci studied (L). Simulation results also indicate that (1) bias of F is small unless alleles with very low frequency are used; (2) precision is typically increased by about the same amount with a doubling of S, t, or L; (3) confidence intervals for Ne computed using a chi 2 approximation are accurate and unbiased under most conditions; (4) the temporal method is best suited for use with organisms having high juvenile mortality and, perhaps, a limited effective population size.},

abstract = {The addition of spatial structure to ecological concepts and theories has spurred integration between sub-disciplines within ecology, including community and ecosystem ecology. However, the complexity of spatial models limits their implementation to idealized, regular landscapes. We present a model meta-ecosystem with finite and irregular spatial structure consisting of local nutrient-autotrophs-herbivores ecosystems connected through spatial flows of materials and organisms. We study the effect of spatial flows on stability and ecosystem functions, and provide simple metrics of connectivity that can predict these effects. Our results show that high rates of nutrient and herbivore movement can destabilize local ecosystem dynamics, leading to spatially heterogeneous equilibria or oscillations across the meta-ecosystem, with generally increased meta-ecosystem primary and secondary production. However, the onset and the spatial scale of these emergent dynamics depend heavily on the spatial structure of the meta-ecosystem and on the relative movement rate of the autotrophs. We show how this strong dependence on finite spatial structure eludes commonly used metrics of connectivity, but can be predicted by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix that describe the spatial structure and scale. Our study indicates the need to consider finite-size ecosystems in meta-ecosystem theory.},

In this note, we formulate the individual based models (IBM) supposedly underlying those deterministic models. The models treat the interaction between a general size-structured consumer population ('Daphnia') and an unstructured resource ('algae'). The discrete, size and age-structured Daphnia population changes through births and deaths of its individuals and through their aging and growth. The birth and death rates depend on the sizes of the individuals and on the concentration of the algae. The latter is supposed to be a continuous variable with a deterministic dynamics that depends on the Daphnia population. In this model setting we prove that when the Daphnia population is large, the stochastic differential equation describing the IBM can be approximated by the delay equation featured in (Diekmann et al., loc. cit.).},

abstract = {The quick answer to the title question is: by bookkeeping; introduce as p(opulation)-state a measure telling how the individuals are distributed over their common i(ndividual)-state space, and track how the various i-processes change this measure. Unfortunately, this answer leads to a mathematical theory that is technically complicated as well as immature. Alternatively, one may describe a population in terms of the history of the population birth rate together with the history of any environmental variables affecting i-state changes, reproduction and survival. Thus, a population model leads to delay equations. This delay formulation corresponds to a restriction of the p-dynamics to a forward invariant attracting set, so that no information is lost that is relevant for long-term dynamics. For such equations there exists a well-developed theory. In particular, numerical bifurcation tools work essentially the same as for ordinary differential equations. However, the available tools still need considerable adaptation before they can be practically applied to the dynamic energy budget (DEB) model. For the time being we recommend simplifying the i-dynamics before embarking on a systematic mathematical exploration of the associated p-behaviour. The long-term aim is to extend the tools, with the DEB model as a relevant goal post.},

abstract = {The unusually long lifespans of humans and the persistence of post-reproductive lifespans in women represent evolutionary puzzles because natural selection cannot directly favour continued living in post-menopausal women or elderly men. Suggested sources of indirect selection require genetic correlations between fitness and survival or reproduction at younger ages, reproduction in the opposite sex, or late-life contributions to offspring or grandoffspring fitness. Here we apply quantitative genetic analyses to data from a historical human population to explicitly test these evolutionary genetic hypotheses. Total genetic selection increased the male post-50 lifespans by 0.138 years per generation; 94{\%} of this arose from indirect selection acting to favour early-life fitness in both sexes. These results argue strongly against life-history models of ageing that depend on trade-offs between reproduction and late-life survival. No source of indirect selection for female post-50 lifespan was detected, deepening the mystery of why female post-reproductive survival persists. This result is probably due to recent changes in the genetic architecture of female lifespan, and it highlights the need for similar quantitative genetic analyses of human populations at other points along demographic transitions. Using a historical dataset, Moorad and Walling investigate possible selection for post-reproductive lifespan in humans, finding indirect selection favouring early-life fitness in both sexes, but none in females over 50.},

BC, linking together a variety of what have previously been disconnected observations and casting doubt on some long-standing existing models. An outline of relevant aspects of life history theory, which provides the foundation for understanding demography, is followed by a review of large-scale demographic patterns in the early Neolithic, which point to rapid population increase and a process of demic diffusion. More localized socioeconomic and demographic patterns suggesting rapid expansion to local carrying capacities and an associated growth of inequality in the earliest farming communities of central Europe (the Linear Pottery Culture, or LBK) are then outlined and shown to correspond to predictions of spatial population ecology and reproductive skew theory. Existing models of why it took so long for farming to spread to northern and northwest Europe, which explain the spread in terms of the gradual disruption of hunter-gatherer ways of life, are then questioned in light of evidence for population collapse at the end of the LBK. Finally, some broader implications of the study are presented, including the suggestion that the pattern of an initial agricultural boom followed by a bust may be relevant in other parts of the world.},

Linguistic and genetic data have been widely compared, but the histories underlying these descriptions are rarely jointly inferred. We developed a unique methodological framework for analysing jointly language diversity and genetic polymorphism data, to infer the past history of separation, exchange and admixture events among human populations. This method relies on approximate Bayesian computations that enable the identification of the most probable historical scenario underlying each type of data, and to infer the parameters of these scenarios. For this purpose, we developed a new computer program PopLingSim that simulates the evolution of linguistic diversity, which we coupled with an existing coalescent-based genetic simulation program, to simulate both linguistic and genetic data within a set of populations. Applying this newprogram to a wide linguistic and genetic dataset ofCentral Asia,we found several differences between linguistic and genetic histories. In particular, we showed how genetic and linguistic exchanges differed in the past in this area: some cultural exchanges were maintained without genetic exchanges. The methodological framework and the linguistic simulation tool developed here can be used in future work for disentangling complex linguistic and genetic evolutions underlying human biological and cultural histories.},

We decompose short-term elasticity as a sum of (i) the effect of the perturbation in rates on the unperturbed population structure and (ii) the effect of the original vital rates on the difference in structure between the original and the perturbed population. We provide exact analytical formulas for these components. In a population at its stable stage distribution (SSD), short-term elasticity is determined mainly by the SSD and reproductive value. In a non-stable population, short-term elasticity depends also on the projection of initial structure on the SSD, equal to population momentum. Non-stable stage structures matter most to elasticity if stages are missing that take time to fill in. We show how the demographic damping rate of the original population determines the rate at which short-term elasticity converges to its limiting values.},

abstract = {Lotka's Stable Population Theory is essentially a one-sex model and, in general, it leads to the inconsistent result of two different intrinsic growth rates for the two sexes. This paper is an attempt to remove this anomaly by building a general stable population model treating sex and age simultaneously. The results are derived by a method analogous to Lotka's, viz., by expressing the birth function in the form of an integral equation, the solution of which gives the consistent intrinsic growth rate. New concepts that are introduced include the intrinsic age-specific birth rates and the intrinsic gross and net reproduction rates for males and females. These intrinsic rates for the two sexes can coexist in a stable population unlike the same rates in the conventional sense which are sex-wise internally inconsistent. Seven specific forms of the general model are considered and applied to data for the United States, 1963. {\textcopyright} 1972.},

abstract = {We consider a continuous age-structured two-sex population model which is given by a semilinear system of partial differential equations with nonlocal boundary conditions and is a simpler case of Fredrickson- Hoppensteadt model. The non-linearity is introduced by a source term, called from its physical meaning, the marriage function. The explicit form of the marriage function is not known; however, there is an understanding among the demographers about the properties it should satisfy. We have shown that the homogeneity property of the non-linearity leads to the fact that the system supports exponentially growing persistent solutions using a general form of the marriage function and its properties. This suggests that the model can be viewed as a possible extension of the one-sex stable population theory to monogamously mating two-sex populations.},

abstract = {In most species, sport hunting of male trophy animals can only reduce overall population size when the rate of removal of males is so high that females can no longer be impregnated1. However, where males provide extensive paternal care, the removal of even a few individuals could harm the population as a whole. In species such as lions, excessive trophy hunting could theoretically cause male replacements (and associated infanticide) to become sufficiently common to prevent cubs reaching adulthood. Here we simulate the population consequences of lion trophy hunting using a spatially explicit, individual-based, stochastic model parameterized with 40 years of demographic data from northern Tanzania. Although our simulations confirm that infanticide increases the risk of population extinction, trophy hunting could be sustained simply by hunting males above a minimum age threshold, and this strategy maximizes both the quantity and the quality of the long-term kill. We present a simple non-invasive technique for estimating lion age in populations lacking long-term records, and suggest that quotas would be unnecessary in any male-only trophy species where age determination could be reliably implemented.},

abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an unstable CAG repeat. For patients at risk, participating in predictive testing and learning of having CAG expansion, a major unanswered question shifts from "Will I get HD?" to "When will it manifest?" Using the largest cohort of HD patients analyzed to date (2913 individuals from 40 centers worldwide), we developed a parametric survival model based on CAG repeat length to predict the probability of neurological disease onset (based on motor neurological symptoms rather than psychiatric onset) at different ages for individual patients. We provide estimated probabilities of onset associated with CAG repeats between 36 and 56 for individuals of any age with narrow confidence intervals. For example, our model predicts a 91{\%} chance that a 40-year-old individual with 42 repeats will have onset by the age of 65, with a 95{\%} confidence interval from 90 to 93{\%}. This model also defines the variability in HD onset that is not attributable to CAG length and provides information concerning CAG-related penetrance rates.},

@article{Moorad2008,
abstract = {Laboratory experiments show us that the deleterious character of accumulated novel age-specific mutations is reduced and made less variable with increased age. While theories of aging predict that the frequency of deleterious mutations at mutation-selection equilibrium will increase with the mutation's age of effect, they do not account for these age-related changes in the distribution of de novo mutational effects. Furthermore, no model predicts why this dependence of mutational effects upon age exists. Because the nature of mutational distributions plays a critical role in shaping patterns of senescence, we need to develop aging theory that explains and incorporates these effects. Here we propose a model that explains the age dependency of mutational effects by extending Fisher's geometrical model of adaptation to include a temporal dimension. Using a combination of simple analytical arguments and simulations, we show that our model predicts age-specific mutational distributions that are consistent with observations from mutation-accumulation experiments. Simulations show us that these age-specific mutational effects may generate patterns of senescence at mutation-selection equilibrium that are consistent with observed demographic patterns that are otherwise difficult to explain.},

abstract = {BRCA1-associated breast and ovarian cancer risks can be modified by common genetic variants. To identify further cancer risk-modifying loci, we performed a multi-stage GWAS of 11,705 BRCA1 carriers (of whom 5,920 were diagnosed with breast and 1,839 were diagnosed with ovarian cancer), with a further replication in an additional sample of 2,646 BRCA1 carriers. We identified a novel breast cancer risk modifier locus at 1q32 for BRCA1 carriers (rs2290854, P = 2.7 x 10(-8), HR = 1.14, 95{\%} CI: 1.09-1.20). In addition, we identified two novel ovarian cancer risk modifier loci: 17q21.31 (rs17631303, P = 1.4 x 10(-8), HR = 1.27, 95{\%} CI: 1.17-1.38) and 4q32.3 (rs4691139, P = 3.4 x 10(-8), HR = 1.20, 95{\%} CI: 1.17-1.38). The 4q32.3 locus was not associated with ovarian cancer risk in the general population or BRCA2 carriers, suggesting a BRCA1-specific association. The 17q21.31 locus was also associated with ovarian cancer risk in 8,211 BRCA2 carriers (P = 2x10(-4)). These loci may lead to an improved understanding of the etiology of breast and ovarian tumors in BRCA1 carriers. Based on the joint distribution of the known BRCA1 breast cancer risk-modifying loci, we estimated that the breast cancer lifetime risks for the 5{\%} of BRCA1 carriers at lowest risk are 28{\%}-50{\%} compared to 81{\%}-100{\%} for the 5{\%} at highest risk. Similarly, based on the known ovarian cancer risk-modifying loci, the 5{\%} of BRCA1 carriers at lowest risk have an estimated lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer of 28{\%} or lower, whereas the 5{\%} at highest risk will have a risk of 63{\%} or higher. Such differences in risk may have important implications for risk prediction and clinical management for BRCA1 carriers.},

abstract = {Families with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) sharing a single PSEN2 mutation exhibit a wide range of age-at-onset, suggesting that modifier loci segregate within these families. While APOE is known to be an age-at-onset modifier, it does not explain all of this variation. We performed a genome scan within nine such families for loci influencing age-at-onset, while simultaneously controlling for variation in the primary PSEN2 mutation (N141I) and APOE. We found significant evidence of linkage between age-at-onset and chromosome 1q23.3 (P {\textless} 0.001) when analysis included all families, and to chromosomes 1q23.3 (P {\textless} 0.001), 17p13.2 (P = 0.0002), 7q33 (P = 0.017), and 11p14.2 (P = 0.017) in a single large pedigree. Simultaneous analysis of these four chromosomes maintained strong evidence of linkage to chromosomes 1q23.3 and 17p13.2 when all families were analyzed, and to chromosomes 1q23.3, 7q33, and 17p13.2 within the same single pedigree. Inclusion of major gene covariates proved essential to detect these linkage signals, as all linkage signals dissipated when PSEN2 and APOE were excluded from the model. The four chromosomal regions with evidence of linkage all coincide with previous linkage signals, associated SNPs, and/or candidate genes identified in independent AD study populations. This study establishes several candidate regions for further analysis and is consistent with an oligogenic model of AD risk and age-at-onset. More generally, this study also demonstrates the value of searching for modifier loci in existing datasets previously used to identify primary causal variants for complex disease traits.},

abstract = {The changing fate of group selection theory illustrates nicely the importance of studying the history of science. It was Charles Darwin that first used something like group selection to explain how natural selection could give rise to altruistic behavior and moral instinct. These instincts could be accommodated by his theory of evolution, he argued, if they had evolved 'for the good of the community'. By the 1960s, group selection had a new and vocal advocate in V.C. Wynne-Edwards. But this gave critics of the theory that selection might act on groups, rather than at the level of individuals or genes, a definable target, and from the mid-1960s to the 1980s group selection was considered the archetypal example of flawed evolutionary thinking. However, at the end of the 20th century ideas of group selection re-emerged as an important component of a multilevel theory of evolution. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Moreover, population genetics studies suggest that some derived alleles that protect against common diseases became advantageous recently. These observations can be explained within an evolutionary framework in which ancestral alleles reflect ancient adaptations to the lifestyle of ancient human populations, whereas the derived alleles were deleterious. However, with the shift in environment and lifestyle, the ancestral alleles now increase the risk of common diseases in modern populations. In this article, we develop an explicit evolutionary model and use population genetics simulations to investigate the expected haplotype structure and type of disease-association signals of ancestral risk alleles. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

LD-based methods work best when there is a single susceptibility allele at any given disease locus, and generally perform very poorly if there is substantial allelic heterogeneity. The extent of allelic heterogeneity at typical complex disease loci is not yet known, but predictions about allelic heterogeneity have important implications for the design of future mapping studies, including the proposed genome-wide association studies. In this article, we review the available data and models relating to the number and frequencies of susceptibility alleles at complex disease loci—the ‘allelic architecture' of human disease genes. We also show that the predicted frequency spectrum of disease variants at a gene depends crucially on the method of ascertainment, for example from prior linkage scans or from surveys of functional candidate loci.},

abstract = {Recent comparative studies point to the importance of mortality schedules as determinants in the evolution of life-history characterstics. In this paper, we compare patterns of mortality from natural populations of mammals with a variety of life histories. We find that, after removing the effects of body weight, mortality is the best predictor of variation in life-history traits. Mammals with high levels of natural mortality tend to mature early and give birth to small offspeing in large litters after a short gestation, before and after body size effects are factored out. We examine the way in which life-history traits relate to juvenile mortality versus adult mortality and find that juvenile mortality is more highly correlated with life-history traits than is adult mortality. We dscuss the necessity of distinguishing between extrinsic sources of mortality (e.g. predation) and mortality caused by intrinsic sources (e.g. costs of reproduction), and the role that ecology might play in the evolution of patterns of mortality and fecundity. We conclude that these results must be explained not simply in the light of the demographic ncessity of balancing mortality and fecundity, but as a result of age-specific costs and benefits of reproduction and parental investment. Detailed comparative studies of mortality patterns in natural populations of mammals offer a promising avenue towards understanding the evoluiton of life-history strategies.},

We explain this variation in inequality using a dynamic model in which a population's long-run steady-state level of inequality depends on the extent to which its most important forms of wealth are transmitted within families across generations. We estimate the degree of intergenerational transmission of three different types of wealth (material, embodied, and relational), as well as the extent of wealth inequality in 21 historical and contemporary populations. We show that intergenerational transmission of wealth and wealth inequality are substantial among pastoral and small-scale agricultural societies (on a par with or even exceeding the most unequal modern industrial economies) but are limited among horticultural and foraging peoples (equivalent to the most egalitarian of modern industrial populations). Differences in the technology by which a people derive their livelihood and in the institutions and norms making up the economic system jointly contribute to this pattern.},

abstract = {Is senescence the adaptive result of tradeoffs between younger and older ages or the nonadaptive burden of deleterious mutations that act at older ages? To shed new light on this unresolved question we combine adaptive and nonadaptive processes in a single model. Our model uses Penna's bit-strings to capture different age-specific mutational patterns. Each pattern represents a genotype and for each genotype we find the life history strategy that maximizes fitness. Genotypes compete with each other and are subject to selection and to new mutations over generations until equilibrium in gene-frequencies is reached. The mutation-selection equilibrium provides information about mutational load and the differential effects of mutations on a life history trait--the optimal age at maturity. We find that mutations accumulate only at ages with negligible impact on fitness and that mutation accumulation has very little effect on the optimal age at maturity. These results suggest that life histories are largely determined by adaptive processes. The non-adaptive process of mutation accumulation seems to be unimportant at evolutionarily relevant ages.},

The budget constraint assumed by past treatments limits the energy used by each individual at each instant to what it produces at that instant. We consider under what conditions energy transfers from adults, which relax the rigid constraint by permitting energetic dependency and faster growth for the offspring, would be advantageous. In a sense, such transfers permit borrowing and lending across the life history. Higher survival and greater efficiency in energy production at older ages than younger both favor the evolution of transfers. We show that if such transfers are advantageous, then increased survival up to the age of making the transfers must co-evolve with the transfers themselves.},

abstract = {The classic evolutionary theory of aging explains why mortality rises with age: as individuals grow older, less lifetime fertility remains, so continued survival contributes less to reproductive fitness. However, successful reproduction often involves intergenerational transfers as well as fertility. In the formal theory offered here, age-specific selective pressure on mortality depends on a weighted average of remaining fertility (the classic effect) and remaining intergenerational transfers to be made to others. For species at the optimal quantity-investment tradeoff for offspring, only the transfer effect shapes mortality, explaining postreproductive survival and why juvenile mortality declines with age. It also explains the evolution of lower fertility, longer life, and increased investments in offspring.},

abstract = {Human disease genes show enormous variation in their allelic spectra; that is, in the number and population frequency of the disease-predisposing alleles at the loci. For some genes, there are a few predominant disease alleles. For others, there is a wide range of disease alleles, each relatively rare. The allelic spectrum is important: disease genes with only a few deleterious alleles can be more readily identified and are more amenable to clinical testing. Here, we weave together strands from the human mutation and population genetics literature to provide a framework for understanding and predicting the allelic spectra of disease genes. The theory does a reasonable job for diseases where the genetic etiology is well understood. It also has bearing on the Common Disease/Common Variants (CD/CV) hypothesis, predicting that at loci where the total frequency of disease alleles is not too small, disease loci will have relatively simple spectra.},

abstract = {Fertility inheritance, a phenomenon in which an individual's number of offspring is positively correlated with his or her number of siblings, is a cultural process that can have a strong impact on genetic diversity. Until now, fertility inheritance has been detected primarily using genealogical databases. In this study, we develop a new method to infer fertility inheritance from genetic data in human populations. The method is based on the reconstruction of the gene genealogy of a sample of sequences from a given population and on the computation of the degree of imbalance in this genealogy. We show indeed that this level of imbalance increases with the level of fertility inheritance, and that other phenomena such as hidden population structure are unlikely to generate a signal of imbalance in the genealogy that would be confounded with fertility inheritance. By applying our method to mtDNA samples from 37 human populations, we show that matrilineal fertility inheritance is more frequent in hunter-gatherer populations than in food-producer populations. One possible explanation for this result is that in hunter-gatherer populations, individuals belonging to large kin networks may benefit from stronger social support and may be more likely to have a large number of offspring.},

We show that in expanding populations, direct environmental effects dominate induced population fluctuations, so environmental variability has little effect on clean hunger levels, although it does decrease population growth. The growth rate determines the time until Population is limited by space This limitation introduces a tradeoff between population density and well-being, so population effects become more important than the direct effects of the environment. environmental fluctuation increases mortality, releasing density dependence and raising average well-being for survivors. We discuss the social implications of these findings for the long-term fate of populations as they transition from expansion into limitation, given that conditions leading to high well-being during growth depress well-being during limitation (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Humans are the longest living and slowest growing of all primates. Although most primates are social, humans are highly cooperative and social in ways that likely co-evolved with the slow human life history. In this paper we highlight the role of resource transfers and non-material assistance within and across generations in shaping low human mortality rates. The use of complex cooperative strategies to minimize risk is a necessary precursor for selecting further reductions in mortality rate in late adulthood. In conjunction with changes in the age-profile of production, the impacts of resource transfers and other forms of cooperation on reducing mortality likely played an important role in selection on post-reproductive lifespan throughout human evolution. Using medical data and ethnographic interviews, we explore several types of common risks experienced by Tsimane forager-horticulturalists, and quantify the types and targets of aid. Our results illustrate the importance of transfers in several key domains and suggest that the absence of transfers would greatly increase human mortality rates throughout the life course.},

Using comprehensive data on the early French Canadian population of Quebec, evidence is provided for a higher risk of dying for motherless children that remains significant over all childhood and long after the death of the mother. The specific effect of the loss of maternal care was estimated by comparing mortality before and after mother's death, furnishing a means to control for family heterogeneity. No differential in investment between genders was detected before age 3, but older girls suffered a three-fold higher susceptibility to mother's death than their male counterparts. This suggests that grown-up girls assuming the responsibilities of the missing mother had a lower chance of survival.},

abstract = {Longitudinal data on natural populations have been analysed using multistage models in which survival depends on reproductive stage, and individuals change stages according to a Markov chain. These models are special cases of stage-structured population models. We show that stage-structured models generate dynamic heterogeneity: life-history differences produced by stochastic stratum dynamics. We characterize dynamic heterogeneity in a range of species across taxa by properties of the Markov chain: the entropy, which describes the extent of heterogeneity, and the subdominant eigenvalue, which describes the persistence of reproductive success during the life of an individual. Trajectories of reproductive stage determine survivorship, and we analyse the variance in lifespan within and between trajectories of reproductive stage. We show how stage-structured models can be used to predict realized distributions of lifetime reproductive success. Dynamic heterogeneity contrasts with fixed heterogeneity: unobserved differences that generate variation between life histories. We show by an example that observed distributions of lifetime reproductive success are often consistent with the claim that little or no fixed heterogeneity influences this trait. We propose that dynamic heterogeneity provides a 'neutral' model for assessing the possible role of unobserved 'quality' differences between individuals. We discuss fitness for dynamic life histories, and the implications of dynamic heterogeneity for the evolution of life histories and senescence.},

In this review I examine human life history from an evolutionary ecological perspective. I first review the evidence for life history trade-offs between fertility and mortality in humans. Patterns of growth, fertility and mortality across the life span are then discussed and illustrated with data from a traditional Gambian population. After outlining the stages of the human life course, I discuss two phenomena of particular interest in evolutionary anthropology, both of which are apparently unique to humans and neither yet fully understood. First, I discuss the evolution of menopause, the curtailing of female reproduction long before death. The evidence that this evolved because investment in existing children's future reproductive success is more important than continuing child bearing into old age is reviewed, along with data relating to the biological constraints that may be operating. Second, I discuss the demographic transition. Declining fertility at a time of increasingly abundant resources represents a serious challenge to an evolutionary view of human life history and behaviour, and is thus examined in detail. Parental investment in children in competition with each other may be key to understanding both of these unusual human phenomena. a 2000 the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {We present a matrix population model for a single-sex human population comprising non-orphan daughters (whose mothers are alive) and orphan daughters (whose mothers are dead). Orphans suffer higher mortality than non-orphans, which simulates the need for daughters to receive maternal care in order to survive. The way that maternal care affects population dynamics and life-history evolution is then analysed for demographic regimes that encompass large ranges of daughter survival, mother survival and fertility. We provide stable age-distributions of orphans and non-orphans for each regime and perform sensitivity analyses on daughter survival, adult survival and fertility. The results show that natural selection will favour (i) faster daughter independence from maternal care, (ii) higher adult survival at all ages, and (iii) early reproduction to the detriment of late reproduction. We then build scenarios concerning the coevolution of daughter survival and maternal care with adult survival and fertility. We also incorporate grandmaternal care into the model. We show that (i) the acute altriciality of human babies, (ii) the increased maternal care resulting from emergence of complex sociality and (iii) the role played by grandmothers in caring for granddaughters may have led to the emergence of specific human life-history traits: a short reproductive period characterised by a reproductive senescence and menopause, as well as an extended lifespan characterised by a post-reproductive life.},

abstract = {Two striking differences between humans and our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and gorillas, are the size of our brains (larger by a factor of three or four) and our life span (longer by a factor of about two). Our thesis is that these two distinctive features of humans are products of coevolutionary selection. The large human brain is an investment with initial costs and later rewards, which coevolved with increased energy allocations to survival. Not only does this theory help explain life history variation among primates and its extreme evolution in humans; it also provides new insight into the evolution of longevity in other biological systems. We introduce and apply a general formal demographic model for constrained growth and evolutionary tradeoffs in the presence of life-cycle transfers between age groups in a population.},

Here, we study the impact of these factors on the force of selection acting on age-specific survival and fertility (measured with elasticity analysis) in a model that incorporates the dependence of child survival on maternal survival. Results reveal life-history changes that cannot be elucidated when considering child's survival independent of maternal survival: decrease of late fertility and increase of late survival, and concomitant decrease of early and late fertility. We also show that an increase of child altriciality in early humans might explain the main human life-history traits: a high life expectancy and postreproductive life; a long juvenile period and a higher, and narrowed, fertility at the peak of the reproductive period.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The steady decline in child mortality observed in most African countries through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s has stalled in many countries in the 1990s because of the AIDS epidemic. However, the census and household survey data that generally are used to produce estimates of child mortality do not permit precise measures of the adverse effect of HIV on child mortality. METHODS: To calculate excess risks of child mortality as the result of maternal HIV status, we used pooled data from 3 longitudinal community-based studies that classified births by the mother's HIV status. We also estimated excess risks of child death caused by increased mortality among mothers. The joint effects of maternal HIV status and maternal survival were quantified using multivariate techniques in a survival analysis. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that the excess risk of death associated with having an HIV-positive mother is 2.9 (95{\%} confidence interval = 2.3-3.6), and this effect lasts throughout childhood. The excess risk associated with a maternal death is 3.9 (2.8-5.5) in the 2-year period centered on the mother's death, with children of both infected and uninfected mothers experiencing higher mortality risks at this time. CONCLUSION: HIV impacts on child mortality directly through transmission of the virus to newborns by infected mothers and indirectly through higher child mortality rates associated with a maternal death.},

abstract = {The magnitude of negative selection on alleles involved in age-specific mortality decreases with age. This is the foundation of the evolutionary theory of senescence. Because of this decrease in negative selection with age, and because of the absence of reproduction after menopause, alleles involved in women's late-onset diseases are generally considered evolutionarily neutral. Recently, genetic and epidemiological data on alleles involved in late onset-diseases have become available. It is therefore timely to estimate selection on these alleles. Here, we estimate selection on BRCA1 alleles leading to susceptibility to late-onset breast and ovarian cancer. For this, we integrate estimates of the risk of developing a cancer for BRCA1-carriers into population genetics frameworks, and calculate selection coefficients on BRCA1 alleles for different demographic scenarios varying across the extent of human demography. We then explore the magnitude of negative selection on alleles leading to a diverse range of risk patterns, to capture a variety of late-onset diseases. We show that BRCA1 alleles may have been under significant negative selection during human history. Although the mean age of onset of the disease is long after menopause, variance in age of onset means that there are always enough cases occurring before the end of reproductive life to compromise the selective value of women carrying a susceptibility allele in BRCA1. This seems to be the case for an extended range of risk of onset functions varying both in mean and variance. This finding may explain the distribution of BRCA1 alleles' frequency, and also why alleles for many late-onset diseases, like certain familial forms of cancer, coronary artery diseases and Alzheimer dementia, are typically recent and rare. Finally, we discuss why the two most popular evolutionary theories of aging, mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy, may underestimate the effect of selection on survival at old ages.},

In this article, I present a completely new approach to transient sensitivity and elasticity analysis, using methods from matrix calculus. Unlike previous methods, this approach applies not only to linear time-invariant models but also to time-varying, subsidized, stochastic, nonlinear and spatial models. It is computationally simple, and does not require calculation of eigenvalues or eigenvectors. The method is presented along with applications to plant and animal populations.},

abstract = {Frontier populations provide exceptional opportunities to test the hypothesis of a trade-off between fertility and longevity. In such populations, mechanisms favoring reproduction usually find fertile ground, and if these mechanisms reduce longevity, demographers should observe higher postreproductive mortality among highly fertile women. We test this hypothesis using complete female reproductive histories from three large demographic databases: the Registre de la population du Qu{\'{e}}bec ancien (Universit{\'{e}} de Montr{\'{e}}al), which covers the first centuries of settlement in Quebec; the BALSAC database (Universit{\'{e}} du Qu{\'{e}}bec {\`{a}} Chicoutimi), including comprehensive records for the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean (SLSJ) in Quebec in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; and the Utah Population Database (University of Utah), including all individuals who experienced a vital event on the Mormon Trail and their descendants. Together, the three samples allow for comparisons over time and space, and represent one of the largest set of natural fertility cohorts used to simultaneously assess reproduction and longevity. Using survival analyses, we found a negative influence of parity and a positive influence of age at last child on postreproductive survival in the three populations, as well as a significant interaction between these two variables. The effect sizes of all these parameters were remarkably similar in the three samples. However, we found little evidence that early fertility affects postreproductive survival. The use of Heckman's procedure assessing the impact of mortality selection during reproductive ages did not appreciably alter these results. We conclude our empirical investigation by discussing the advantages of comparative approaches.},

abstract = {Life expectancy is increasing in most countries and has exceeded 80 in several, as low-mortality nations continue to make progress in averting deaths. The health and economic implications of mortality reduction have been given substantial attention, but the observed malleability of human mortality has not been placed in a broad evolutionary context. We quantify the rate and amount of mortality reduction by comparing a variety of human populations to the evolved human mortality profile, here estimated as the average mortality pattern for ethnographically observed hunter-gatherers. We show that human mortality has decreased so substantially that the difference between hunter-gatherers and today's lowest mortality populations is greater than the difference between hunter-gatherers and wild chimpanzees. The bulk of this mortality reduction has occurred since 1900 and has been experienced by only about 4 of the roughly 8,000 human generations that have ever lived. Moreover, mortality improvement in humans is on par with or greater than the reductions in mortality in other species achieved by laboratory selection experiments and endocrine pathway mutations. This observed plasticity in age-specific risk of death is at odds with conventional theories of aging.},

abstract = {The "mother" hypothesis is one of the main adaptive explanations of human menopause. It postulates that reproductive cessation constitutes a strategy that has been selected for during human evolution because mothers at older ages might maximize their fitness by investing resources in the survival and reproduction of their living children rather than by continuing to reproduce. This study provides a test of this hypothesis. Fertility functions that maximize fitness are built into a model incorporating the fact that the survival of females during the rearing period is a major determinant of their children's survival. Results are given according to different scenarios of increase with mothers' age of maternal mortality risk and risk of stillbirth and birth defects (on the assumption that these females do not experience menopause). Different estimates of the effect of a mother's death on her child's survival were also incorporated. Finally, a population genetics framework allows us to estimate selection on these optimal fertility functions. To determine whether or not these fertility functions show a menopause, three criteria are discussed: the rapidity of fertility decline, if any; the magnitude of selection on menopause compared with a nonmenopausal strategy; and the selection on survival during post-reproductive life. Our results show that menopause and subsequent post-reproductive life are significantly advantageous when two conditions are satisfied: a marked increase in stillbirth and risk of birth defects as well as in maternal mortality with mother's age.},

abstract = {Little is known about the nature of genetic variation underlying complex diseases in humans. One popular view proposes that mapping efforts should focus on identification of susceptibility mutations that are relatively old and at high frequency. It is generally assumed-at least for modeling purposes-that selection against complex disease mutations is so weak that it can be ignored. In this article, I propose an explicit model for the evolution of complex disease loci, incorporating mutation, random genetic drift, and the possibility of purifying selection against susceptibility mutations. I show that, for the most plausible range of mutation rates, neutral susceptibility alleles are unlikely to be at intermediate frequencies and contribute little to the overall genetic variance for the disease. Instead, it seems likely that the bulk of genetic variance underlying diseases is due to loci where susceptibility mutations are mildly deleterious and where there is a high overall mutation rate to the susceptible class. At such loci, the total frequency of susceptibility mutations may be quite high, but there is likely to be extensive allelic heterogeneity at many of these loci. I discuss some practical implications of these results for gene mapping efforts.},

abstract = {Optimality approaches have been used to investigate the adaptiveness of human subsistence strategies mainly in hunter-gatherer societies. However the 'static' optimality models used are not suitable for investigating the long-term costs and benefits of decisions, especially in societies where wealth is accumulated and hence resources gained in one year have an influence on future years. Here I use dynamic optimality modelling to investigate the adaptiveness of a subsistence strategy in the Gabbra, a nomadic pastoralist group. I show that herders forego short-term gain in favour of long-term household survival. This is done by herders sometimes manipulating the life histories of their sheep. In herds where the breeding rate has been slowed, by restricting ewes' access to males, females have greater longevity, but fewer offspring per year, than in unmanipulated herds. Models maximising offtake from the herd predict that herd breeding-rate should never be slowed. Models maximising short-term household survival predict herdbreeding rate should always be slowed. Models of long-term household survival predict that herd-breeding rate should be slowed only by relatively wealthy households. This is the behaviour observed. Poor and wealthy households adopt different behaviours, yet all are following optimal strategies for their own level of wealth, that maximise their long-term survival. This is the behaviour that would be predicted on the basis of evolutionary theory, given that a family takes many years to be raised.},

abstract = {The observation of high frequencies of certain inherited disorders in the population of Saguenay-Lac Saint Jean can be explained in terms of the variance and the correlation of effective family size (EPS) from one generation to the next. We have shown this effect by using the branching process approach with real demographic data. When variance of EFS is included in the model, despite its profound effect on mutant allele frequency, any mutant introduced in the population never reaches the known carrier frequencies (between 0.035 and 0.05). It is only when the EFS correlation between generations is introduced into the model that we can explain the rise of the mutant alleles. This correlation is described by a c parameter that reflects the dependency of children's EFS on their parents' EFS. The c parameter can be considered to reflect social transmission of demographic behavior. We show that such social transmission dramatically reduces the effective population size. This could explain particular distributions in allele frequencies and unusually high frequency of certain inherited disorders in some human populations.},

abstract = {The disposable soma theory on the evolution of ageing states that longevity requires investments in somatic maintenance that reduce the resources available for reproduction. Experiments in Drosophila melanogaster indicate that trade-offs of this kind exist in non-human species. We have determined the interrelationship between longevity and reproductive success in Homo sapiens using a historical data set from the British aristocracy. The number of progeny was small when women died at an early age, increased with the age of death, reaching a plateau through the sixth, seventh and eighth decades of life, but decreased again in women who died at an age of 80 years or over. Age at first childbirth was lowest in women who died early and highest for women who died at the oldest ages. When account was taken only of women who had reached menopause, who were aged 60 years and over, female longevity was negatively correlated with number of progeny and positively correlated with age at first childbirth. The findings show that human life histories involve a trade-off between longevity and reproduction.},

abstract = {Why do humans survive so long past reproductive age, and why does juvenile mortality decline after birth, both contrary to the classic theory of aging? Previous work has shown formally that intergenerational transfers can explain both these patterns. Here, simulations confirm those results under weaker assumptions and explore how different social arrangements shape life-history evolution. Simulated single-sex hunter{\^{a}}€“gatherers survive, forage, reproduce, and share food with kin and nonkin in ways guided by the ethnographic literature. Natural selection acts on probabilistically occurring deleterious mutations. Neither stable population age distributions nor homogeneous genetic lineages are assumed. When food is shared only within kin groups, an infant death permits reallocation of its unneeded food to the infant's kin, offsetting the fitness cost of the death and weakening the force of selection against infant mortality. Thus, evolved infant mortality is relatively high, more so in larger kin groups. Food sharing with nonkin reduces the costs to kin of child rearing, but also reduces the resources recaptured by kin after an infant death, so evolved infant mortality is lower. Postreproductive adults transfer food to descendants, enhancing their growth and survival, so postreproductive survival is selected. The force of selection for old-age survival depends in complicated ways on the food-sharing arrangements. Population-level food sharing with nonkin leads to the classic pattern of constant low mortality up to sexual maturity and no postreproductive survival.},

abstract = {Environmental stochasticity is known to play an important role in life-history evolution, but most general theory assumes a constant environment. In this paper, we examine life-history evolution in a variable environment, by decomposing average individual fitness (measured by the long-run stochastic growth rate) into contributions from average vital rates and their temporal variation. We examine how generation time, demographic dispersion (measured by the dispersion of reproductive events across the lifespan), demographic resilience (measured by damping time), within-year variances in vital rates, within-year correlations between vital rates and between-year correlations in vital rates combine to determine average individual fitness of stylized life histories. In a fluctuating environment, we show that there is often a range of cohort generation times at which the fitness is at a maximum. Thus, we expect 'optimal' phenotypes in fluctuating environments to differ from optimal phenotypes in constant environments. We show that stochastic growth rates are strongly affected by demographic dispersion, even when deterministic growth rates are not, and that demographic dispersion also determines the response of life-history-specific average fitness to within- and between-year correlations. Serial correlations can have a strong effect on fitness, and, depending on the structure of the life history, may act to increase or decrease fitness. The approach we outline takes a useful first step in developing general life-history theory for non-constant environments.},

abstract = {From a comparative perspective, human life histories are unique and raising offspring is unusually costly: humans have relatively short birth intervals compared to other apes, childhood is long, mothers care simultaneously for many dependent children (other apes raise one offspring at a time), infant mortality is high in natural fertility/mortality populations, and human females have a long post-reproductive lifespan. These features conspire to make child raising very burdensome. Mothers frequently defray these costs with paternal help (not usual in other ape species), although this contribution is not always enough. Grandmothers, elder siblings, paid allocarers, or society as a whole, help to defray the costs of childcare, both in our evolutionary past and now. Studying offspring care in a various human societies, and other mammalian species, a wide range of specialists such as anthropologists, psychologists, animal behaviorists, evolutionary ecologists, economists and sociologists, have contributed to this volume, offering new insights into and a better understanding of one of the key areas of human society.},

abstract = {In the human species, the two uniparental genetic systems (mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome) exhibit contrasting diversity patterns. It has been proposed that sex-specific behaviours, and in particular differences in migration rate between men and women, may explain these differences. The availability of high-density genomic data and the comparison of genetic patterns on autosomal and sex chromosomes at global and local scales allow a reassessment of the extent to which sex-specific behaviours shape our genome. In this article, we first review studies comparing the genetic patterns at uniparental and biparental genetic systems and assess the extent to which sex-specific migration processes explain the differences between these genetic systems. We show that differences between male and female migration rates matter, but that they are certainly not the only contributing factor. In particular, differences in effective population size between men and women are also likely to account for these differences. Then, we present and discuss three anthropological processes that may explain sex-specific differences in effective population size and thus human genomic variation: (i) variance in reproductive success arising from, for example, polygyny; (ii) descent rules; and (iii) transmission of reproductive success. 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Hamilton1966,
abstract = {The consequences to fitness of several types of small age-specific effects on mortality are formulated mathematically. An effect of given form always has a larger consequence, or at least one as large, when it occurs earlier. By reference to a model in which mortality is constant it is shown that this implication cannot be avoided by any conceivable organism. A basis for the theory that senescence is an inevitable outcome of evolution is thus established. The simple theory cannot explain specially high infant mortalities. Fisher's “reproductive value”, the form of which gave rise to an erroneous opinion on this point, is shown to be not directly relevant to the situation. Infant mortality may evolve when the early death of one infant makes more likely the creation or survival of a close relative. Similarly, post-reproductive life-spans may evolve when the old animal still benefits its younger relatives. The model shows that higher fertility will be a primary factor leading to the evolution of higher rates of senescence unless the resulting extra mortality is confined to the immature period. Some more general analytical notes on the consequences of modifications to the reproductive schedule are given. Applications to species with populations in continual fluctuation are briefly discussed. Such species apart, it is argued that general stationarity of population can be assumed, in which case the measurement of consequences to fitness in terms of consequences to numerical expectation of offspring is justified. All the age-functions discussed are illustrated by graphs derived from the life-table of the Taiwanese about 1906, and the method of computation is shown.},

Human behavioural ecologists propose adaptive hypotheses to explain this variation as shifting phenotypic optima in relation to local socioecological niches. Here we review evidence that variation in fertility (offspring number), in both traditional and modern industrialized populations, represents optimization of the life-history trade-off between reproductive rate and parental investment. While a reliance on correlational methods suggests the true costs of sibling resource competition are often poorly estimated, a range of anthropological and demographic studies confirm that parents balance family size against offspring success. Evidence of optimization is less forthcoming. Declines in fertility associated with modernization are particularly difficult to reconcile with adaptive models, because fertility limitation fails to enhance offspring reproductive success. Yet, considering alternative measures, we show that modern low fertility confers many advantages on offspring, which are probably transmitted to future generations. Evidence from populations that have undergone or initiated demographic transition indicate that these rewards to fertility limitation fall selectively on relatively wealthy individuals. The adaptive significance of modern reproductive behaviour remains difficult to evaluate, but may be best understood in response to rising investment costs of rearing socially and economically competitive offspring.},

abstract = {Senescence-the deterioration of survival and reproductive capacity with increasing age-is generally held to be an evolutionary consequence of the declining strength of natural selection with increasing age. The diversity in rates of aging observed in nature suggests that the rate at which age-specific selection weakens is determined by species-specific ecological factors. We propose that, in iteroparous species, relationships between parental age, offspring birth order, and environment may affect selection on senescence. Later-born siblings have, on average, older parents than do first borns. Offspring born to older parents may experience different environments in terms of family support or inherited resources, factors often mediated by competition from siblings. Thus, age-specific selection on parents may change if the environment produces birth-order related gradients in reproductive success. We use an age-and-stage structured population model to investigate the impact of sibling environmental inequality on the expected evolution of senescence. We show that accelerated senescence evolves when later-born siblings are likely to experience an environment detrimental to lifetime reproduction. In general, sibling inequality is likely to be of particular importance for the evolution of senescence in species such as humans, where family interactions and resource inheritance have important roles in determining lifetime reproduction.},

abstract = {An enduring puzzle of human life history is why women cease reproduction midway through life. Selection can favor postreproductive survival because older females can help their offspring to reproduce. But the kin-selected fitness gains of helping appear insufficient to outweigh the potential benefits of continued reproduction. Why then do women cease reproduction in the first place? Here, we suggest that early reproductive cessation in humans is the outcome of reproductive competition between generations, and we present a simple candidate model of how this competition will be resolved. We show that among primates exhibiting a postreproductive life span, humans exhibit an extraordinarily low degree of reproductive overlap between generations. The rapid senescence of the human female reproductive system coincides with the age at which, in natural fertility populations, women are expected to encounter reproductive competition from breeding females of the next generation. Several lines of evidence suggest that in ancestral hominids, this younger generation typically comprised immigrant females. In these circumstances, relatedness asymmetries within families are predicted to give younger females a decisive advantage in reproductive conflict with older females. A model incorporating both the costs of reproductive competition and the benefits of grandmothering can account for the timing of reproductive cessation in humans and so offers an improved understanding of the evolution of menopause.},

abstract = {Evolutionary theory predicts that senescence, a decline in survival rates with age, is the consequence of stronger selection on alleles that affect fertility or mortality earlier rather than later in life. Hamilton quantified this argument by showing that a rare mutation reducing survival is opposed by a selective force that declines with age over reproductive life. He used a female-only demographic model, predicting that female menopause at age ca. 50 yrs should be followed by a sharp increase in mortality, a "wall of death." Human lives obviously do not display such a wall. Explanations of the evolution of lifespan beyond the age of female menopause have proven difficult to describe as explicit genetic models. Here we argue that the inclusion of males and mating patterns extends Hamilton's theory and predicts the pattern of human senescence. We analyze a general two-sex model to show that selection favors survival for as long as men reproduce. Male fertility can only result from matings with fertile females, and we present a range of data showing that males much older than 50 yrs have substantial realized fertility through matings with younger females, a pattern that was likely typical among early humans. Thus old-age male fertility provides a selective force against autosomal deleterious mutations at ages far past female menopause with no sharp upper age limit, eliminating the wall of death. Our findings illustrate the evolutionary importance of males and mating preferences, and show that one-sex demographic models are insufficient to describe the forces that shape human senescence.},

abstract = {Models of population dynamics generally assume that child survival is independent of maternal survival. However, in humans, the death of a mother compromises her immature children's survival because children require postnatal care. A child's survival therefore depends on her mother's survival in years following her birth. Here, we provide a model incorporating this relationship and providing the number of children surviving until maturity achieved by females at each age. Using estimates of the effect that a mother's death has on her child's survival until maturity, we explore the effect of the model on population dynamics. Compared to a model that includes a uniform child survival probability, our model slightly raises the finite rate of increase lambda and modifies generation time and the stable age structure. We also provide estimates of selection on alleles that change the survival of females. Selection is higher at all adult ages in our model and remains significant after menopause (at ages for which the usual models predict neutrality of such alleles). Finally, the effect of secondary caregivers who compensate maternal care after the death of a mother is also emphasized. We show that allocare (as an alternative to maternal care) can have a major effect on population dynamics and is likely to have played an important role during human evolution.},

abstract = {We present a population model to examine the forces that determined the quality and quantity of human life in early agricultural societies where cultivable area is limited. The model is driven by the non-linear and interdependent relationships between the age distribution of a population, its behavior and technology, and the nature of its environment. The common currency in the model is the production of food, on which age-specific rates of birth and death depend. There is a single non-trivial equilibrium population at which productivity balances caloric needs. One of the most powerful controls on equilibrium hunger level is fertility control. Gains against hunger are accompanied by decreases in population size. Increasing worker productivity does increase equilibrium population size but does not improve welfare at equilibrium. As a case study we apply the model to the population of a Polynesian valley before European contact. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The available detail, specificity, and consistency of vital rates for the past and the accuracy of vital rates projected for the future necessarily limit the accuracy of the kinship estimates that can be produced. This study is an external validity test of Reeves' 1982 reconstruction and forecast of U.S. kin counts with the SOCSIM microsimulation program [1]. The external standard is provided by estimates from the 1987-88 wave of the National Survey of Families and Households, the first detailed information on numbers and ages of kin for the United States. We compare forecasts with estimates for average numbers of living grandchildren, living full-siblings, and living half-siblings as functions of age. We find remarkably close agreement for some of the predictions, along with several instances of systematic discrepancies. The discrepancies most likely stem from errors in the forecasts rather than in the survey estimates. Interacting rather than isolable errors appear to be responsible. Our validity tests provide a basis for qualified faith in the effectiveness of kinship microsimulation.},

abstract = {Human menopause is ubiquitous among women and is uninfluenced by modernity. In addition, it remains an evolutionary puzzle: studies have largely failed to account for diminishing selection on reproduction beyond 50 years. Using a 200-year dataset on pre-industrial Finns, we show that an important component is between-generation reproductive conflict among unrelated women. Simultaneous reproduction by successive generations of in-laws was associated with declines in offspring survivorship of up to 66{\%}. An inclusive fitness model revealed that incorporation of the fitness consequences of simultaneous intergenerational reproduction between in-laws, with those of grandmothering and risks of dying in childbirth, were sufficient to generate selection against continued reproduction beyond 51 years. Decomposition of model estimates suggested that the former two were most influential in generating selection against continued reproduction. We propose that menopause evolved, in part, because of age-specific increases in opportunities for intergenerational cooperation and reproductive competition under ecological scarcity.},

abstract = {Many studies have shown that health conditions experienced in childhood play an important role on an individual's adult mortality. Recent research suggests that past reductions in early life exposure to infectious diseases have been a major contributor to the historical decline in old-age mortality. Drawing on French-Canadian data from cohorts born in the 17th and 18th centuries, we test whether a progressive deterioration in early life conditions (as revealed by an increasing infant mortality rate) translates into a decrease in survival prospects in late life. We use traditional demographic measures such as the age-specific probability of death, and a series of proportional hazard models to control for familial and environmental conditions. Results point toward little evidence of any early life effects. The trend of increasing infant mortality does not correlate with a general increase of mortality in older ages within the same cohorts. Period changes affecting survival at older ages (war, epidemics) as well as demographic and biological characteristics shared within families have a much larger role in old-age mortality than early life characteristics shared within the same cohorts.},

@article{Gillespie2008,
abstract = {Maternal fitness should be maximized by the optimal division of reproductive investment between offspring number and offspring quality. While evidence for this is abundant in many taxa, there have been fewer tests in mammals, and in particular, humans. We used a dataset of humans spanning three generations from pre-industrial Finland to test how increases in maternal fecundity affect offspring quality and maternal fitness in contrasting socio-economic conditions. For 'resource-poor' landless families, but not 'resource-rich' landowning families, maternal fitness returns diminished with increased maternal fecundity. This was because the average offspring contribution to maternal fitness declined with increased maternal fecundity for landless but not landowning families. This decline was due to reduced offspring recruitment with increased maternal fecundity. However, in landowning families, recruited offspring fecundity increased with increased maternal fecundity. This suggests that despite decreased offspring recruitment, maternal fitness is not reduced in favourable socio-economic conditions due to an increase in subsequent offspring fecundity. These results provide evidence consistent with an offspring quantity-quality trade-off in the lifetime reproduction of humans from poor socio-economic conditions. The results also highlight the importance of measuring offspring quality across their whole lifespan to estimate reliably the fitness consequences of increased maternal fecundity.},

The presence of heterogeneity is assessed by comparing the distribution of child deaths for women with a chance distribution. To weigh the relative contribution of causes of within-and between-family heterogeneity in the risk of child death to the observed pattern of clustering, detailed simulations in which empirical child-based data from the study are used, are undertaken. There are important variations in child mortality between families in this community, and the familial component in child mortality is almost entirely correlated with the size of the family. High-risk women experience repeated child deaths and repeated short birth intervals; they therefore have larger families. Heterogeneity in mortality and selective fertility, however, fail to explain the observed association between low mortality risk and small family size.},

abstract = {The VATER/VACTERL association is typically defined by the presence of at least three of the following congenital malformations: vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac malformations, tracheo-esophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb abnormalities. The identification of 14 twin pairs with an initial diagnosis of VATER/VACTERL association at our clinical centers led to the performance of a classical twin study. This involved a thorough evaluation of these 14 twin pairs and a further 55 twin pairs identified from a systematic review of the literature. The zygosity, concordance, and malformation status of all 69 twin pairs were evaluated. Twenty-four twin pairs fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in a comparison of the concordance rates between monozygous (MZ) and dizygous (DZ) twin pairs. The pairwise concordance rates were 15{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 4-42{\%}] for MZ and 18{\%} (95{\%} CI 5-48{\%}) for DZ twin pairs (P=0.53). The probandwise concordance rates were 27{\%} (95{\%} CI 11-52{\%}) for MZ and 31{\%} (95{\%} CI 13-58{\%}) for DZ twin pairs (P=0.40). Although based on a limited number of twin pairs, the findings of the present study are consistent with the low number of familial cases reported to date, and suggest that the role of inherited genetic factors in the majority of VATER/VACTERL cases is limited.},

abstract = {Human behavioral ecologists have shown that the reproductive lives of women are affected by both their husbands and the grandmothers of their children. Study of the combined effect of the roles of the husbands and mothers of 650 Khasi women aged 16-50 years supports the ideas that the reproductive agendas of husbands may require more than women want to invest and that mothers provide support and protective services to their daughters and grandchildren. In the absence of the woman's mother, the husband's agenda appears to have more influence on her reproductive career. In a cooperative vein, women's mothers may contribute to good marital choices. A view of reproductive pursuits that incorporates in-laws enhances behavioral ecology approaches to the evolutionary comprehension of human reproductive behavior. This view also more readily interfaces with the cultural systems that set up the ecologies of reproductive life.},

Examination of variations in the quality of infant care and the symptoms of infant distress in Kipsigis infants (aged eleven to fifteen months) yields the following results: (1) mother's absence does not diminish the quality of infant care nor increase the distress exhibited by the infant; (2) caretakers provide infant care of quality equal to that provided by the mother, and they maintain greater proximity with the infant; (3) polygynously married mothers are absent from their infants more than are monogamously married mothers, but the quality of infant care does not otherwise differ between polygynous and monogamous households; (4) contrary to predictions based on previous studies, neither the number of coresident caretakers in the infant's household nor the observed numbers of caretakers have significantly positive effects on the quality of infant care.},

abstract = {The common occurrence of food transfers within human hunter-gatherer and forager-horticulturalist groups presents exciting test cases for evolutionary models of altruism. While kin biases in sharing are consistent with nepotism based on kin selection, there is much debate over the extent to which reciprocal altruism and tolerated scrounging provide useful explanations of observed behavior. This paper presents a model of optimal sharing breadth and depth, based on a general non-tit-for-tat form of risk-reduction based reciprocal altruism, and tests a series of predictions using data from Hiwi and Ache foragers. I show that large, high variance food items are shared more widely than small, easily acquired food items. Giving is conditional upon receiving in pairwise interactions and this correlation is usually stronger when the exchange of value rather than quantities is considered. Larger families and low producing families receive more and give less, consistent with the notion that marginal value may be a more salient currency than quantity.},

abstract = {A major goal in human genetics is to understand the role of common genetic variants in susceptibility to common diseases. This will require characterizing the nature of gene variation in human populations, assembling an extensive catalogue of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes and performing association studies for particular diseases. At present, our knowledge of human gene variation remains rudimentary. Here we describe a systematic survey of SNPs in the coding regions of human genes. We identified SNPs in 106 genes relevant to cardiovascular disease, endocrinology and neuropsychiatry by screening an average of 114 independent alleles using 2 independent screening methods. To ensure high accuracy, all reported SNPs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. We identified 560 SNPs, including 392 coding-region SNPs (cSNPs) divided roughly equally between those causing synonymous and non-synonymous changes. We observed different rates of polymorphism among classes of sites within genes (non-coding, degenerate and non-degenerate) as well as between genes. The cSNPs most likely to influence disease, those that alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, are found at a lower rate and with lower allele frequencies than silent substitutions. This likely reflects selection acting against deleterious alleles during human evolution. The lower allele frequency of missense cSNPs has implications for the compilation of a comprehensive catalogue, as well as for the subsequent application to disease association.},

abstract = {The early-life developmental environment is instrumental in shaping our overall adult health and well-being. Early-life diet and endocrine exposure may independently, or in concert with our genetic constitution, induce a pathophysiological process that amplifies with age and leads to premature morbidity and mortality. Recently, this has become known as ‘programming' but is akin to ‘maternal effects' described for many years in the biological sciences and is defined as any influence that acts during critical developmental windows to induce long-term changes in the organisms' phenotype. To date, such delayed maternal effects have largely been characterized in terms of susceptibility to cardiovascular or metabolic disease. Here, we review evidence from experimental animal species, non-human primates and man for an effect of the early-life nutritional environment on adult fecundity and fertility. In addition, using a database of pedigree sheep, we also specifically test the hypothesis that being born small for gestational age with or without post-natal growth acceleration directly programmes fertility. We conclude that there is a lack of compelling evidence to suggest pre-natal undernutrition may directly reduce adult fecundity and fertility, but may exert some effects secondarily via an increased incidence of ‘metabolic syndrome'. Possible effects of being born relatively large on subsequent fecundity and fertility warrant further investigation.},

@article{Mace2012,
abstract = {Many studies show that the extended human family can be helpful in raising offspring, with maternal grandmothers, in particular, improving offspring survival. However, less attention has been given to competition between female kin and co-residents. It has been argued that reproductive conflict between generations explains the evolution of menopause in cooperatively breeding species where females disperse, and that older females are related to the offspring of younger females through their sons, whereas younger, incoming females are unrelated to older females. This means the pattern of help will be asymmetric, so older females lose in reproductive conflict and become ‘sterile helpers'. Here, we seek evidence for female reproductive competition using longitudinal demographic data from a rural Gambian population, and examine when women are helping or harming each other's reproductive success. We find that older women benefit and younger women suffer costs of reproductive competition with women in their compound. But the opposite is found for mothers and daughters; if mother and daughter's reproductive spans overlap, the older woman reduces her reproduction if the younger woman (daughter) reproduces, whereas daughters' fertility is unaffected by their mothers' reproduction. Married daughters are not generally co-resident with their mothers, so we find not only competition effects with co-resident females, but also with daughters who have dispersed. Dispersal varies across human societies, but our results suggest reproductive conflict could be influencing reproductive scheduling whatever the dispersal pattern. A cultural norm of late male marriage reduces paternal grandmother/daughter-in-law reproductive overlap almost to zero in this population. We argue that cultural norms surrounding residence and marriage are themselves cultural adaptations to reduce reproductive conflict between generations in human families.},

abstract = {We conducted a meta-analysis of 17 studies that tested for an association between grandparental survival and grandchild survival in patrilineal populations. Using two different methodologies, we found that the survival of the maternal grandmother and grandfather, but not the paternal grandmother and grandfather, was associated with decreased grandoffspring mortality. These results are consistent with the findings of psychological studies in developed countries (Coall and Hertwig Behavioral and Brain Sciences 33:1-59, 2010). When tested against the predictions of five hypotheses (confidence of paternity; grandmothering, kin proximity, grandparental senescence, and local resource competition), our meta-analysis results are most in line with the local resource competition hypothesis. In patrilineal and predominantly patrilocal societies, the grandparents who are most likely to live with the grandchildren have a less beneficial association than those who do not. We consider the extent to which these results may be influenced by the methodological limitations of the source studies, including the use of retrospective designs and inadequate controls for confounding variables such as wealth.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite major progress made over the past 10 years, malaria remains one of the primary causes of ill health in developing countries in general, and in sub-Saharan Africa in particular. Whilst a large literature has documented the frequency and severity of malaria infections for children under-five years, relatively little evidence is available regarding the impact of early childhood malaria exposure on subsequent child development. METHODS: The objective of the study was to assess the associations between early childhood exposure to malaria and pre-school development. Child assessment data for 1,410 children in 70 clusters collected through the 2010 Zambian Early Childhood Development Project was linked with malaria parasite prevalence data from the 2006 Zambia Malaria Indicator Survey. Linear and logistic models were used to estimate the effect of early childhood exposure to malaria on anthropometric outcomes as well as on a range of cognitive and behavioural development measures. RESULTS: No statistically significant associations were found between parasite exposure and children's height and weight. Exposure to the malaria parasite was, however, associated with lower ability to cope with cognitive tasks administered by interviewers (z-score difference -1.11, 95{\%} CI -2.43-0.20), as well as decreased overall socio-emotional development as assessed by parents (z-score difference -1.55, 95{\%} CI -3.13-0.02). No associations were found between malaria exposure and receptive vocabulary or fine-motor skills. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented in this paper suggest potentially large developmental consequences of early childhood exposure to malaria. Continued efforts to lower the burden of malaria will not only reduce under-five mortality, but may also have positive returns in terms of the long-term well-being of exposed cohorts.},

abstract = {Month of birth influences adult life expectancy at ages 50+. Why? In two countries of the Northern Hemisphere-Austria and Denmark-people born in autumn (October-December) live longer than those born in spring (April-June). Data for Australia show that, in the Southern Hemisphere, the pattern is shifted by half a year. The lifespan pattern of British immigrants to Australia is similar to that of Austrians and Danes and significantly different from that of Australians. These findings are based on population data with more than a million observations and little or no selectivity. The differences in lifespan are independent of the seasonal distribution of deaths and the social differences in the seasonal distribution of births. In the Northern Hemisphere, the excess mortality in the first year of life of infants born in spring does not support the explanation of selective infant survival. Instead, remaining life expectancy at age 50 appears to depend on factors that arise in utero or early in infancy and that increase susceptibility to diseases later in life. This result is consistent with the finding that, at the turn of the last century, infants born in autumn had higher birth weights than those born in other seasons. Furthermore, differences in adult lifespan by month of birth decrease over time and are significantly smaller in more recent cohorts, which benefited from substantial improvements in maternal and infant health.},

abstract = {Because children's ability to support themselves falls below their consumption, human young are subsidized by others throughout much of their growth and development. Mothers, however, who often have multiple dependents of different ages, are faced with an allocation problem (Fig. 1). This has led to important debate about the evolution of a long period dependence and the development of nonmaternal strategies to provision young. This article focuses on the critical role that children themselves play. Because the human subsistence niche incorporates a broad diversity of resources that require variable procurement and processing costs, dependent children can also be important producers, furthering both a need and an opportunity for cooperative breeding.},

This framework is based upon three conceptual pillars: ecological constraints theory, inclusive fitness theory, and reproductive skew theory. I offer a set of 15 predictions pertaining to living within family groups. The logic of each is discussed, and empirical evidence from family-living vertebrates is summarized. I argue that knowledge of four basic parameters, (i) genetic relatedness, (ii) social dominance, (iii) the benefits of group living, and (iv) the probable success of independent reproduction, can explain many aspects of family life in birds and mammals. I suggest that this evolutionary perspective will provide insights into understanding human family systems as well.},

This extension allows us to introduce non-genetic fertility correlation in the forward in time process and to study its effects on the genealogies of individuals (or genes) samples. Since it is independent of the gene considered, this effect is uniform on the genome, even in diploid populations. For values of fertility correlation observed in human populations, we show that coalescence times are strongly but inhomogenously reduced and that the shape of gene genealogies is markedly unbalanced. Despite the fact that our simulations concern stationary populations, the former non-genetic effect is very similar to what has been described for populations of variable size such as populations passing through demographic bottleneck. However, additional strong tree imbalance due to non-genetic causes is reported here for the first time. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Furthermore, genetic dissection of the intensity and type of selection acting on human genes can be used to predict involvement in different forms and severities of human diseases. We review here the progress made in population genetics studies toward understanding the effects of selection, in its different forms and intensities, on human genome diversity. We discuss some outstanding, robust examples of genes and biological functions subject to strong dietary, climatic and pathogen selection pressures. We also explore the possible relationship between cancer and natural selection, a topic that has been largely neglected because cancer is generally seen as a late-onset disease. Finally, we discuss how the present-day incidence of some diseases of modern societies may represent a by-product of past adaptation to other selective forces and changes in lifestyle. This perspective thus illustrates the value of adopting a population genetics approach in delineating the biological mechanisms that have played a major evolutionary role in the way humans have genetically adapted to different environments and lifestyles over time.},

abstract = {This study applies principles from the theory of household life cycles to the study of early childhood mortality in the population of the Northern Orkney Islands, Scotland. The primary hypothesis is that unfavorable household economic conditions resulting from changes in household demographic composition increase the risk of death for children under the age of 5 years because of limited resources and intra-household competition. We apply Cox proportional hazards models to nearly 5,000 linked birth and death records from the Northern Orkney Islands, Scotland, from the period 1855 to 2001. The dependent variable is the child's risk of death before age 5. Findings suggest that children in households with unfavorable age compositions face higher risk of death. This elevated risk of death continues once heterogeneity among children, islands, and households is controlled. Results also show differential risk of death for male children, children of higher birth orders, and twin births. The analyses present evidence for intra-household competition in this historic setting. The most convincing evidence of competition is found in the effects of household consumer/producer ratios and twinning on child mortality risks.},

@article{Brandenburg2012,
abstract = {Summary Fertility transmission (FT) is a phenomenon with a cultural and/or genetic basis, whereby a positive correlation exists between the number of offspring of an individual and that of his/her parents. Theoretical studies using a haploid individual-based model have shown that FT increases the variance and intergenerational correlation in reproductive success and results in an imbalance in the coalescent tree of sampled genes. This phenomenon has been documented in several demographic studies conducted on the correlation in fertility between generations, or through the reconstruction of the genealogical trees of mitochondrial DNA sequences. However, as mtDNA is a single locus, potentially subject to other forces (e.g. natural selection), it is of interest to extend the theory of FT to nuclear loci. We show that because random mating between individuals leads to a mixing of their fertility profiles, FT in these cases will have less influence on the variance and intergenerational correlation of reproductive success. This, in turn, results in less impact on the shape of the coalescent trees. Nevertheless, in the presence of FT, high heterogeneity in reproductive success and homogamy for family size will increase the imbalance in the coalescent tree. Thus, FT should be easier to detect when occurring in conjunction with these other factors. We also show the utility of analysing different kinds of loci (X-linked, Y-linked, mitochondrial and autosomal) to assess whether FT is matrilineal, patrilineal or biparental. Finally, we demonstrate that the shape of the coalescent tree depends upon population size, in contrast to the classical Kingman's model.},

@article{Rogers1993,
abstract = {George Williams proposed in 1957 that menopause evolved because, late in life, women have more to gain from child care than from continued fertility. I develop here a quantitative model of this idea in order to determine whether the proposed benefit is in fact larger than the cost. To make this work possible, I introduce an age-structured theory of kin selection that allows for a time delay between an act of altruism and the benefit it provides. Using this theory, I show that in age-structured populations, conventional inclusive fitness calculations are justified for effects on fertility only when either the population is stationary or there is no delay between cost and benefit. For effects on mortality, conventional calculations also require that donor and recipient be affected at the same age. I then introduce two versions of Williams' idea. Model I assumes that menopause is maintained because it reduces the risk of mortality during childbirth, thus increasing the provision of parental care. The analysis demonstrates that this model is incapable of accounting for menopause. Model II assumes that menopause facilitates parental care by reducing the time during which a woman is partially incapacitated by the demands of pregnancy and infant care. This model could not be rejected. However, a definitive test will require parameter estimates that are not yet available.},

abstract = {What evolutionary forces shape genes that contribute to the risk of human disease? Do similar selective pressures act on alleles that underlie simple versus complex disorders [1-3]? Answers to these questions will shed light onto the origin of human disorders (e.g., [4]) and help to predict the population frequencies of alleles that contribute to disease risk, with important implications for the efficient design of mapping studies [5-7]. As a first step toward addressing these questions, we created a hand-curated version of the Mendelian Inheritance in Man database (OMIM). We then examined selective pressures on Mendelian-disease genes, genes that contribute to complex-disease risk, and genes known to be essential in mouse by analyzing patterns of human polymorphism and of divergence between human and rhesus macaque. We found that Mendelian-disease genes appear to be under widespread purifying selection, especially when the disease mutations are dominant (rather than recessive). In contrast, the class of genes that influence complex-disease risk shows little signs of evolutionary conservation, possibly because this category includes targets of both purifying and positive selection.},

The identification of rare variants involves the careful selection of candidate genes to examine, the availability of highly efficient resequencing techniques and the appropriate assessment of the functional consequences of the implicated variant. We believe that this strategy can be successfully applied at present in order to unravel the contribution of rare variants to the multifactorial inheritance of common diseases, which could lead to the implementation of much needed preventative screening schemes.},

The extent of family clustering is estimated before and after controlling for observed child and family demographic, reproductive, and socioeconomic characteristics and unobserved community characteristics. The study also investigates the extent to which the coefficient estimates and standard errors are altered with better controls for unobserved heterogeneity at the family level and at the community level. These controls are achieved through the use of a multilevel nested frailty model for survival data. The variance of family frailty is overstated by a factor of four when unobserved community effects are omitted. The family-level variance is not statistically significant in the multilevel model, although it is highly significant in the model that includes only the family frailty effect. Furthermore, ignoring the full design effects results in systematic bias in parameter estimates and standard errors.},

Languages fit a tree model of evolution well, at least in their basic vocabulary, challenging the view that blending, or admixture among neighbouring groups, was predominant in cultural history. Here, we argue that we can use language trees to test hypotheses about not only cultural history and diversification, but also bio-cultural adaptation. Phylogenetic comparative methods take account of the non-independence of cultures (Galton's problem), which can cause spurious statistical associations in comparative analyses. Advances in phylogenetic methods offer new possibilities for the analysis of cultural evolution, including estimating the rate of evolution and the direction of coevolutionary change of traits on the tree. They also enable phylogenetic uncertainty to be incorporated into the analyses, so that one does not have to treat phylogenetic trees as if they were known without error.},

abstract = {Reproductive senescence, a life-history trait virtually unique to human females, is thought to be the result of a fitness trade-off between increased maternal investment in existing progeny and continued reproduction, With the altriciality-life span hypothesis I propose (1) that menopause arose because continuing encephalization caused hominid infants to be born in an increasing state of secondary altriciality, requiring a mother to invest more prolonged and more intensive care in her own offspring; (2) that, originally, hominid females underwent menopause at an earlier age; and (3) that reproductive senescence was instrumental in increasing maximum potential lifespan and average life expectancies, which set up a feedback that resulted in its own upward secular trend. A model generated by the altriciality-life span hypothesis supports the propositions that premature reproductive cessation can offer fitness benefits before age 50 years if it results in increases in maternal care leading to substantial improvement in offspring survival and fertility.},

abstract = {Throughout the living world trade-offs between reproductive success and longevity have been observed. In general, two extremes of life history patterning are reported, r- and K-selected species. The latter tend toward larger body sizes, few offspring from any one pregnancy, few offspring over the female reproductive span, longer life spans, and greater parental investment (PI: all efforts and expenses associated with the production, gestation, post-natal care, feeding, and protection of young) (e.g., whales, elephants, hominids). r-selected species tend toward smaller body size, multiple births/litters per pregnancy, female production of many gametes and offspring over the life span, and low levels of PI (e.g., most plants, insects, mice). These differences have significant influences on physiological variation among human populations. Across human samples, reproductive success (RS: the number of offspring successfully birthed and reared to reproductive age) has been reported to vary positively, negatively, and not at all with longevity of women. This complexity may be in part due to the fact that both early-life and late-life fecundity are associated with longevity in women, while total parity seems a poor gauge of female longevity in humankind. Large variations in associations of RS with longevity in women suggest that multiple factors may confound this association. One confounding factor is that among women, RS is largely determined not by fecundity, but by the quality of PI available to offspring. Among modern humans, PI is more complex, longer lasting (both relatively and absolutely), and extensive than for any other mammal. This suggests that modern human life history is a reflection of the co-evolution of longevity and extensive PI as part of our species' biocultural evolution. The need for long-term PI has greatly shaped human physiological variation and patterns of longevity.},

abstract = {The tradeoff between offspring quantity and offspring quality is at the heart of most evolutionary approaches to the fertility transition, as it is for demographers oriented towards economic explanations for this transition. To date, however, there have been few empirical tests of the key idea that humans trade offspring quantity for quality, and no strictly comparative work designed to identify the specific environmental conditions that favor such a tradeoff. This study suggests that in an East African community where the principal form of intergenerational inheritance is land, intermediate levels of offspring production are favored for women but not men. Women produce approximately the optimal number of surviving children, whereas men produce far fewer than the optimal number. The result highlights the significance of inheritable extrasomatic capital, in conjunction with evolved psychological mechanisms, in shaping fertility strategies that emphasize quality over quantity.},

We used a large demographic dataset on preindustrial humans from Finland to study the effect of elder siblings on key life-history traits. The presence of elder siblings improved the chances of younger siblings surviving to sexual maturity, suggesting that despite a competition for parental resources, they may help rearing their younger siblings. After reaching sexual maturity however, same-sex elder siblings' presence was associated with reduced reproductive success in the focal individual, indicating the existence of competition among same-sex siblings. Overall, lifetime fitness was reduced by same-sex elder siblings' presence and increased by opposite-sex elder siblings' presence. Our study shows opposite effects of sibling interactions depending on the life-history stage, and highlights the need for using long-term fitness measures to understand the selection pressures acting on sibling interactions.},

abstract = {Recent discoveries of hundreds of common susceptibility SNPs from genome-wide association studies provide a unique opportunity to examine population genetic models for complex traits. In this report, we investigate distributions of various population genetic parameters and their interrelationships using estimates of allele frequencies and effect-size parameters for about 400 susceptibility SNPs across a spectrum of qualitative and quantitative traits. We calibrate our analysis by statistical power for detection of SNPs to account for overrepresentation of variants with larger effect sizes in currently known SNPs that are expected due to statistical power for discovery. Across all qualitative disease traits, minor alleles conferred "risk" more often than "protection." Across all traits, an inverse relationship existed between "regression effects" and allele frequencies. Both of these trends were remarkably strong for type I diabetes, a trait that is most likely to be influenced by selection, but were modest for other traits such as human height or late-onset diseases such as type II diabetes and cancers. Across all traits, the estimated effect-size distribution suggested the existence of increasingly large numbers of susceptibility SNPs with decreasingly small effects. For most traits, the set of SNPs with intermediate minor allele frequencies (5-20{\%}) contained an unusually small number of susceptibility loci and explained a relatively small fraction of heritability compared with what would be expected from the distribution of SNPs in the general population. These trends could have several implications for future studies of common and uncommon variants.},

This has been attributed to men selecting young women due to their high reproductive value and women preferring older men due to their wealth and high social status. Such mate preferences have been suggested to be adaptive, but despite a flourishing number of studies on the mate selection patterns themselves, little is still known of their actual fitness consequences. We examined how the age difference between spouses who married only once affected their lifetime reproductive success in historical monogamous Sami populations. We found that men maximized their fitness by marrying women approximately 15 years younger and vice versa. However, most couples failed to marry optimally. Only 10{\%} of marriages fell within the optimal parental age difference, suggesting that cultural and ecological constraints for maximizing fitness were considerable. Those who succeeded in marrying optimally were the most preferred partners: young women and old men. Our findings indicate that, in Sami, parental age difference was under natural and sexual selection, as suggested by evolutionary theory.},

However, no consensus exists regarding the generation interval length, and a wide variety of interval lengths have been used in recent studies. This makes comparison between studies difficult, and questions the accuracy of divergence date estimations. Recent genealogy-based research suggests that the male generation interval is substantially longer than the female interval, and that both are greater than the values commonly used in genetics studies. This study evaluates each of these hypotheses in a broader cross-cultural context, using data from both nation states and recent hunter-gatherer societies. Both hypotheses are supported by this study; therefore, revised estimates of male, female, and overall human generation interval lengths are proposed. The nearly universal, cross-cultural nature of the evidence justifies using these proposed estimates in Y-chromosomal, mitochondrial, and autosomal DNA-based population divergence studies.},

abstract = {We explain how upward transfers from adult children to their elderly parents might evolve as an interrelated feature of a deepening intergenerational division of labor. Humans have a particularly long period of juvenile dependence requiring both food and care time provided mainly by younger and older adults. We suggest that the division of labor evolves to exploit comparative advantage between young and old adults in fertility, childcare and foraging. Eventually the evolving division of labor reaches a limit when the grandmother's fertility reaches zero (menopause). Continuing, it may hit another limit when the grandmother's foraging time has been reduced to her subsistence needs. Further specialization can occur only with food transfers to the grandmother, enabling her to reduce her foraging time to concentrate on additional childcare. We prove that this outcome can arise only after menopause has evolved. We describe the conditions necessary for both group selection (comparative steady state reproductive fitness) and individual selection (successful invasion by a mutation), and interpret these conditions in terms of comparative advantages.},

abstract = {It has been argued that the priority that natural selection places on reproduction negatively affects other processes such as longevity and the problem posed by this trade-off underlies the disposable soma theory for the evolution of human ageing. Here we examine the relationship between reproduction and longevity in a historical human population (the Krummhorn, north-west Germany 1720-1870). In our initial analyses, we found no support for the hypothesized negative effects of reproduction on longevity: married women who remained childless lived no longer than women who reproduced and women who had few children lived no longer than women who had many children. However, more detailed analyses in relation to socio-economic class revealed that the extent to which reproduction has an effect on longevity is a function of the level of economic deprivation. We found that, when possible sources of confound were controlled for (e.g. duration of marriage and amount of time spent in fecund marriage), there is an increasingly strong relationship between longevity and reproduction with increasing poverty.},

abstract = {Most animals reproduce until they die, but in humans, females can survive long after ceasing reproduction(1,2). In theory, a prolonged post-reproductive lifespan will evolve when can gain greater fitness by increasing the success of their offspring than by continuing to breed themselves(3-6). Although reproductive success is known to decline in old age(1-6), it is unknown whether women gain fitness by prolonging lifespan post-reproduction. Using complete multi-generational demographic records, we show that women with a prolonged post-reproductive lifespan have more grandchildren, and hence greater fitness, in pre-modern populations of both Finns and Canadians. This fitness benefit arises because post-reproductive mothers enhance the lifetime reproductive success of their offspring by allowing them to breed earlier, more frequently and more successfully. Finally, the fitness benefits of prolonged lifespan diminish as the reproductive output of offspring declines. This suggests that in female humans, selection for deferred ageing should wane when one's own offspring become post-reproductive and, correspondingly, we show that rates of female mortality accelerate as their offspring terminate reproduction.},

@article{Bell1991,
abstract = {The life cycle of eukaryotes has a dual nature, composed of a vegetative cycle of growth and reproduction, and a sexual cycle of fusion and reduction, linked by the spore. Large size is often favoured through interactions with other organisms, or as a means of exploiting locally or temporarily abundant resources, despite the metabolic penalty of size increase. Beyond a certain point, large organisms must be multicellular (or multinucleate) because of the requirement for more deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to service larger quantities of cytoplasm. Multicellularity evolves in some lineages but not in others because its evolution is constrained by the pattern of spore development, being favoured, for example by the occurrence of multiple fission as the consequence of possessing a rigid cell wall. The separation of soma from germ is also the outcome of a developmental constraint, in this case the inability of cells to divide while flagellated, and also the necessity of remaining in motion. Once achieved, a general physiological advantage is realized through the specialization of soma as source and germ as sink. Large, complex multicellular organisms are fragile constructs that can only persist through deploying sophisticated devices for maintenance. Thus two crucial, and related, properties of life cycles are repair and repeatability. The dual life cycle achieves exogenous repair through spore production in the vegetative cycle and through outcrossing and recombination in the sexual cycle. Repeatability is enhanced by developmental mechanisms such as maternal control and germ-line sequestration, which by restricting the occurrence or the heritability of somatic mutations promote their own replication.},

abstract = {Populations can die out in many ways. We investigate one basic form of extinction, stable or intrinsic extinction, caused by individuals on the average not being able to replace themselves through reproduction. The archetypical such population is a subcritical branching process, i.e., a population of independent, asexually reproducing individuals, for which the expected number of progeny per individual is less than one. The main purpose is to uncover a fundamental pattern of nature. Mathematically, this emerges in large systems, in our case subcritical populations, starting from a large number, x, of individuals. First we describe the behavior of the time to extinction T: as x grows to infinity, it behaves like the logarithm of x, divided by r, where r is the absolute value of the Malthusian parameter. We give a more precise description in terms of extreme value distributions. Then we study population size partway (or u-way) to extinction, i.e., at times uT, for 0 {\textless} u {\textless} 1, e.g., u = 1/2 gives halfway to extinction. (Note that mathematically this is no stopping time.) If the population starts from x individuals, then for large x, the proper scaling for the population size at time uT is x into the power u - 1. Normed by this factor, the population u-way to extinction approaches a process, which involves constants that are determined by life span and reproduction distributions, and a random variable that follows the classical Gumbel distribution in the continuous time case. In the Markov case, where an explicit representation can be deduced, we also find a description of the behavior immediately before extinction.},

Evolutionary anthropologists have so far largely focussed on measuring the influence of kin on reproduction in natural fertility populations. Here we look at the effect in a present-day low-fertility population, by analysing whether kin affect parity progression in the British Household Panel Study. Two explanatory variables related to kin influence significantly increase the odds of a female having a second birth: i) having relatives who provide childcare and ii) having a larger number of frequently contacted and emotionally close relatives. Both effects were measured subject to numerous socio-economic controls and appear to be independent of one another. We therefore conclude that kin may influence the progression to a second birth. This influence is possibly due to two proximate mechanisms: kin priming through communication and kin assistance with childcare.},

abstract = {In human females allocation of resources to support reproduction may cause their insufficient supply to other metabolic functions, resulting in compromised physiology, increased risks of diseases and, consequently, reduced lifespan. While many studies on both historical and contemporary populations show that women with high fertility indeed have shorter lifespans. This relationship is far from universal: a lack of correlation between fertility and lifespan, or even an increased lifespan of women with high fertility have also been documented. Reduced lifespan in women with high fertility may be undetectable due to methodological weaknesses of research or it may be truly absent, and its absence may be explained from biological principles. I will discuss the following reasons for a lack of the negative relationship, described in some demographic studies, between the number of children and lifespan in women: (1) Number of children is only a proxy of the total costs of reproduction and the cost of breastfeeding is often higher than the pregnancy cost but is often not taken into account. (2) Costs of reproduction can be interpreted in a meaningful way only when they are analyzed in relation to the overall energy budget of the woman. (3) Trade-offs between risks of different diseases due to reproduction yield different mortality predictions depending on the socio-economic status of the studied populations. (4) Costs of reproduction are related not only to having children but also to having grandchildren. Such intergenerational costs should be included in analysis of trade-offs between costs of reproduction and longevity.},

Between the start of spawning and death, secondary sexual characters decreased in relative size by 3.3-12.7{\%}. Mass-specific somatic energy declined from freshwater entry (6.7{\%} fat, 20.6{\%} protein, 6.6 kJ.g(-1)) to the start of spawning (1.6{\%} fat, 18.0{\%} protein, 4.5 kJ.g(-1)) and finally to death (0.1{\%} fat, 14.4{\%} protein, 2.9 kJ.g(-1)). Stored fat appeared to be used primarily for upriver migration and egg production, whereas stored protein appeared to be used primarily for the development of secondary sexual characters and metabolism during spawning. Most development of secondary sexual characters occurred late in maturation, perhaps to forestall deterioration of muscle tissue. Relative to populations with long freshwater migrations, Bristol Bay sockeye salmon stored less fat before entering fresh water and used less fat before death. The total energy cost of reproduction (freshwater entry until death, including gonad investment) was 74.1{\%} for females and 66.1{\%} for males, higher than levels typically reported for iteroparous salmonids.},

abstract = {Natural populations live in heterogeneous environments, where habitat variation drives the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. The key feature of population structure addressed in this paper is the net flow of individuals from source (good) to sink (poor) habitats. These movements make it necessary to calculate fitness across the full range of habitats encountered by the population, rather than independently for each habitat. As a consequence, the optimal phenotype in a given habitat not only depends on conditions there but is linked to the performance of individuals in other habitats. We generalize the Euler-Lotka equation to define fitness in a spatially heterogeneous environment in which individuals disperse among habitats as newborn and then stay in a given habitat for life. In this case, maximizing fitness (the rate of increase over all habitats) is equivalent to maximizing the reproductive value of newborn in each habitat but not to maximizing the rate of increase that would result if individuals in each habitat were an isolated population. The new equation can be used to find optimal reaction norms for life history traits, and examples are calculated for age at maturity and clutch size. In contrast to previous results, the optimal reaction norm differs from the line connecting local adaptations of isolated populations each living in only one habitat. Selection pressure is higher in good and frequent habitats than in poor and rare ones. A formula for the relative importance of these two factors allows predictions of the habitat in which the genetic variance about the optimal reaction norm should be smallest.},

abstract = {This paper attempts first to deal with the question of aging as a byproduct of natural selection, drawing on the theories of Medawar, Williams and Hamilton, and second, to apply the conclusions to considerations of population and behavioral ecology. It is concluded that: (1) Age-specific mortality should drop to a minimum prior to earliest reproductive age and then rise with age. (2) Age-specific fecundity should rise with age to a peak, which may occur at almost any age depending on the sort of organism considered, and then fall. (3) A sudden increase in mortality at a given age will result in natural selection favoring higher relative mortality at immediately preceding and following ages, and lowered fecundity immediately after that age. (4) A sudden increase in fecundity at a given age will result in natural selection favoring relative higher mortality in early life and immediately after that age, as well as relaxed selection for increased fecundity, especially at middle and late ages. (5) Selection acts to make increasingly steep the survivorship curve of a population declining or fluctuating due to changes in mortality. (6) Selection acts to postpone reproductive effort in populations declining or fluctuating due to changes in fecundity. (7) If mortality is very low, animals, as they age, should ideally take greater risks to secure reproductive success. (8) The nature of altruistic behavior may be age specific, with older individual more characteristically altruistic and younger individuals more characteristically pampered. (9) Intergroup hostilities should be largely directed toward certain age groups.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Updated National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory Medicine Practice Guidelines for the use of tumor markers in the clinic have been developed. METHODS: Published reports relevant to use of tumor markers for 4 cancer sites--liver, bladder, cervical, and gastric--were critically reviewed. RESULTS: Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) may be used in conjunction with abdominal ultrasound for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis associated with hepatitis B or C virus infection. AFP concentrations {\textgreater}200 microg/L in cirrhotic patients with typical hypervascular lesions {\textgreater}2 cm in size are consistent with HCC. After a diagnosis of HCC, posttreatment monitoring with AFP is recommended as an adjunct to imaging, especially in the absence of measurable disease. Although several urine markers have been proposed for bladder cancer, none at present can replace routine cystoscopy and cytology in the management of patients with this malignancy. Some may, however, be used as complementary adjuncts to direct more effective use of clinical procedures. Although carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19-9 have been proposed for use gastric cancer and squamous cell carcinoma antigen for use in cervical cancer, none of these markers can currently be recommended for routine clinical use. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of these recommendations should encourage optimal use of tumor markers for patients with liver, bladder, cervical, or gastric cancers.},

Over the last 30 years it has become apparent that the predicted proportionality is often not observed when evaluated across species. We develop a general allometric approach to correct for size-related differences in the resources available for reproduction. Using data on mammals, we demonstrate that the predicted inverse proportional relationship between number of offspring and offspring size is closely approached after correcting for allocation, though there is a slight curvature in the relationship. We discuss applications for this ap- proach to other organisms, possible causes for the curvature, and the usefulness of allometries for estimating life-history variables that are difficult to measure.},

abstract = {We used life-history theory to predict reaction norms for age and size at maturation. We assumed that fecundity increases with size and that juvenile mortality rates of offspring decrease as ages-at-maturity of parents increase, then calculated the reaction norm by varying growth rate and calculating an optimal age at maturity for each growth rate. The reaction norm for maturation should take one of at least four shapes that depend on specific relations between changes in growth rates and changes in adult mortality rates, juvenile mortality rates, or both. Most organisms should mature neither at a fixed size nor at a fixed age, but along an age-size trajectory. The model makes possible a clear distinction between the genetic and phenotypic components of variation. The evolved response to selection is reflected in the shape and position of the reaction norm. The phenotypic response of a single organism to rapid or slow growth is defined by the location of its maturation event as a point on the reaction norm. A quantitative test with data from 19 populations and species of fish showed that predictions were in good agreement with observations (r = 0.93, P {\textless} 0.0001). The predictions of the model also agreed qualitatively with observed phenotypic variation in age and size at maturity in humans, platyfish, fruit flies, and red deer. This preliminary success suggests that experiments designed to test the predictions directly will be worthwhile. Received},

abstract = {Environmental conditions shape population growth through their impact on demographic parameters. While knowledge has accumulated concerning the effects of population density and climatic conditions, a topical question now concerns how predation and harvest influence demographic parameters and population growth (03BB). We performed a comparative demographic analysis based on projection matrix models for female roe deer. Population-specific matrices were parameterized based on longitudinal data from five intensively monitored populations in Norway and France, spanning a large variability in environmental characteristics such as densities of large predators, hunter harvest and seasonality. As expected for a large iteroparous vertebrate, temporal variation was invariably higher in recruitment than in adult survival, and the elasticity of adult survival was consistently higher than that of recruitment. However, the relative difference in elasticity of 03BB to recruitment and adult survival varied strongly across populations, and was closely correlated with adult survival. Different traits accounted for most of the variance in 03BB in different ecological settings. Adult survival generally contributed more in populations with low mean adult survival and low mean growth rate during the study period. Hunters and predators (Eurasian lynx and red foxes) occurred in two of our study populations and contributed substantially to the variance in 03BB, accounting for a total of 35{\%} and 70{\%} in the two populations respectively. Across populations, we did not find any evidence that roe deer increased their reproductive output when faced with harsh conditions, resulting in some populations having negative growth rates. Generation time, a measure of the speed of the life-history cycle, increased from less than 4 years in the most productive population ('roe deer heaven') to more than 6 years in declining populations facing predation from lynx, red fox and hunters ('roe deer hell'), and was tightly and inversely correlated with 03BB. Such a deceleration of the life cycle in declining populations might be a general feature in large herbivores. Our results shows that the plethora of environmental conditions faced by populations of large herbivores also induce high intraspecific variation in their ranking along the 'fast2013slow' continuum of life-history tactics},

With no environmental autocorrelation, the dynamics of total population size, N, generally shows time lags and autocorrelation caused by life history, which may strongly bias estimates of environmental variance obtained by ignoring age structure. In contrast, the total reproductive value, V, is Markovian and obeys a first-order autoregressive process. This suggests a simple method for estimating the environmental variance, and avoiding potentially large bias due to age-structure fluctuations, by converting a multivariate time series of age structure to a univariate time series of ln V. We illustrate the method by estimating the long-run growth rate and the environmental variance in an exponentially growing population of Bighorn Sheep. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Using a long-term demographic data set, we estimated the separate effects of demographic and environmental stochasticity in the growth rate of the great tit population in Wytham Wood, United Kingdom. Assuming logistic density regulation, both the demographic (sigma2d = 0.569) and environmental (sigma2e = 0.0793) variance, with interactions included, were significantly greater than zero. The estimates of the demographic variance seemed to be relatively insensitive to the length of the study period, whereas reliable estimates of the environmental variance required long time series (at least 15 yr of data). The demographic variance decreased significantly with increasing population density. These estimates are used in a quantitative analysis of the demographic factors affecting the risk of extinction of this population. The very long expected time to extinction of this population (approximately 10(19) yr) was related to a relatively large population size ({\textgreater}/=120 pairs during the study period). However, for a given population size, the expected time to extinction was sensitive to both variation in population growth rate and environmental stochasticity. Furthermore, the form of the density regulation strongly affected the expected time to extinction. Time to extinction decreased when the maximum density regulation approached K. This suggests that estimates of viability of small populations should be given both with and without inclusion of density dependence.},

We present easily interpretable expressions for the sensitivities and elasticities of life expectancy to vital rates in age-stage models, and illustrate their application with two biological examples.

The demographic stochasticity decreased with adult survival rate, age at maturity, and generation time or the position of the species toward the slow end of the slow-fast life-history gradient. This relationship between life-history characteristics and de-mographic stochasticity was related to interspecific differences in the variation among females in recruitment as well as to differences in the individual variation in survival. Because reproductive decisions in birds are often subject to strong natural selection, our results provide strong evidence for adaptive modifications of reproductive investment through life-history evolution of the influence of stochastic variation on avian population dynamics.},

abstract = {The population growth rate is linked to the distribution of age at death. We demonstrate that this link arises because both the birth and death rates depend on the variance of age-at-death. This bears the prospect to separate the influences of the age patterns of fertility and mortality on population growth rate. Here, we show how the age pattern of death affects population growth. Using this insight we derive a new approximation of the population growth rate that uses the first and second moments of the age-at-death distribution. We apply our new approximation to 46 mammalian life tables (including humans) and show that it is on par with the most prominent other approximations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In most matrix population projection models, individuals are characterized according to, usually, one or two traits such as age, stage, size or location. A broad theory of multitrait population projection matrices (MPPMs) incorporating larger number of traits was long held back by time and space computational complexity issues. As a consequence, no study has yet focused on the influence of the structure of traits describing a life-cycle on population dynamics and life-history evolution. We present here a novel vector-based MPPM building methodology that allows to computationally-efficiently model populations characterized by numerous traits with large distributions, and extend sensitivity analyses for these models. We then present a new method, the trait level analysis consisting in folding an MPPM on any of its traits to create a matrix with alternative trait structure (the number of traits and their characteristics) but similar asymptotic properties. Adding or removing one or several traits to/from the MPPM and analyzing the resulting changes in spectral properties, allows investigating the influence of the trait structure on the evolution of traits. We illustrate this by modeling a 3-trait (age, parity and fecundity) population designed to investigate the implications of parity–fertilitytrade-offs in a context of fecundity heterogeneity in humans. The trait level analysis, comparing models of the same population differing in trait structures, demonstrates that fertility selection gradients differ between cases with or without parity–fertility trade-offs. Moreover it shows that age-specific fertility has seemingly very different evolutionary significance depending on whether heterogeneity is accounted for. This is because trade-offs can vary strongly in strength and even direction depending on the trait structure used to model the population.},

We tested the hypothesis that bighorn ewes that raise sons incur greater reproductive costs than ewes that raise daughters. Although ewe mass gain during lactation and subsequent winter body mass loss were independent of lamb sex, lambs born the year following the weaning of a son had lower survival than lambs born after a daughter. The effects of lamb sex on subsequent reproductive success of ewes became more evident at high population density. Lamb sex did not affect maternal survival. Population density, weather, and ewe age did not alter the relationship between lamb sex and subsequent reproductive success of the ewe. The year after weaning a son, ewes were more likely to have a daughter than a son, while ewes that had previously weaned a daughter had similar numbers of sons and daughters. Our results show that for bighorn sheep ewes, sons have a greater life-history cost than daughters, suggesting a differential maternal investment in the sexes.},

In this paper, the model is adapted to egg size/number trade-offs. 2. The predictions of the model are tested within various clades of waterfowl. Although the relationship between egg mass and clutch size in this group has been examined previously, prior analyses have either failed to take phylogenetic structure into account or relied upon phylogenies that lack resolution. Phylogenetic structure is adjusted for using recently constructed phylogenies and the method of phylogenetically independent contrasts. 3. Van Noordwijk and de Jong's model was successful in explaining between-clade variation in the relationship between egg mass and clutch size. Even if a trade-off between egg size and number exists, a negative relationship will only be observed if the variation in the pattern of allocation (i.e. few large eggs vs many small eggs) is high relative to the variation in the amount of resources invested in the clutch. Thus, this model may be useful for understanding interspecific relationships as well as intraspecific patterns.},

This trade-off is found both between morphs and within the macropterous morph, in which fecundity is negatively correlated with the mass of the principle flight muscles, the dorso-longitudinal muscles (DLM). In this paper, we examine how this trade-off is affected by a reduction in food and its genetic basis. We find that the relative fitness of the two wing morphs is not changed although both fecundity and DLM mass are decreased. A quantitative genetic analysis shows that the trade-off function is genetically variable but that most of the variation occurs in the intercept rather than the slope of the function. Analysis further indicates a very high genetic correlation between environments (food ration) supporting the hypothesis of a strong functional constraint between reproduction and flight capability.},

A major quantitative trait locus that increases adult life span by 20{\%} has no detectable effect on early fecundity. Several recombinant genotypes are superflies, exhibiting both elevated early fecundity and long life. The genetic correlation of early fecundity and life span is not different from zero, while the midlife fecundity correlation is positive and statistically significant, suggesting age-specific adaptation. The results are not consistent with a dominant role for negative pleiotropy, but can be understood in terms of a mixture of pleiotropic and recombining nonpleiotropic elements.

abstract = {The concept of phenotypic trade-offs is a central element in evolutionary theory. In general, phenotypic models assume a fixed trade-off function, whereas quantitative genetic theory predicts that the trade-off function will change as a result of selection. For a linear trade-off function selection will readily change the intercept but will have to be relatively stronger to change the slope. We test these predictions by examining the trade-off between fecundity and flight capability, as measured by dorso-longitudinal muscle mass, in four different populations of the sand cricket, Gryllus firmus. Three populations were recently derived from the wild, and the fourth had been in the laboratory for 19 years. We hypothesized that the laboratory population had most likely undergone more and different selection from the three wild populations and therefore should differ from these in respect to both slope and intercept. Because of geographic variation in selection, we predicted a general difference in intercept among the four populations. We further tested the hypothesis that this intercept will be correlated with proportion macropterous and that this relationship will itself vary with environmental conditions experienced during both the nymphal and adult period. Observed variation in the phenotypic trade-off was consistent with the predictions of the quantitative genetic model. These results point to the importance of modeling trade-offs as dynamic rather than static relationships. We discuss how phenotypic models can incorporate such variation. The phenotypic trade-off between fecundity and dorso-longitudinal muscle mass is determined in part by variation in body size, illustrating the necessity of considering trade-offs to be multi factorial rather than simply bivariate relationships.},

Ageing is an intriguing problem in evolutionary biology because a trait that limits the duration of life, including the fertile period, has a negative impact on Darwinian fitness. Current theory suggests that senescence occurs because the force of natural selection declines with age and because longevity is only acquired at some metabolic cost. In effect, organisms may trade late survival for enhanced reproductive investments in earlier life. The comparative study of ageing supports the general evolutionary theory and reveals that human senescence, while broadly similar to senescence in other mammalian species, has distinct features, such as menopause, that may derive from the interplay of biological and social evolution.},

abstract = {Survival probability is of interest primarily as a component of population dynamics. Only when survival estimates are included in a demographic model are their population implications apparent. Survival describes the transition between living and dead. Biologically important as this transition is, it is only one of many transitions in the life cycle. Others include transitions between immature and mature, unmated and mated, breeding and non– breeding, larva and adult, small and large, and location x and location y. The demographic consequences of these transitions can be captured by matrix population models, and such models provide a natural link connecting multi–stage mark–recapture methods and population dynamics. This paper explores some of those connections, with examples taken from an ongoing analysis of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). Formulating problems in terms of a matrix population model provides an easy way to compute the likelihood of capture histories. It extends the list of demographic parameters for which maximum likelihood estimates can be obtained to include population growth rate, the sensitivity and elasticity of population growth rate, the net reproductive rate, generation time, measures of transient dynamics. In the future, multi–stage mark–recapture methods, linked to matrix population models, will become an increasingly important part of demography.},

abstract = {Both individual-based models (IBMs) and matrix projection models are commonly used to simulate fish population dynamics. We questioned whether matrix models could be used to predict population responses of the prey in a highly coupled predator-prey system. The matrix approach was evaluated for predicting yellow perch population responses to changes in survival, and comparing the responses to those from a detailed IBM. The IBM explicitly modeled effects of walleye predation and competition with yellow perch, whereas the matrix models used averaged values, and in some cases density-dependent relationships, for survival, growth, and reproduction of yellow perch that implicitly included walleye effects. We used the output from a 200-year simulation of the IBM as data for estimating the elements of three alternative versions of a matrix projection model. We constructed an age-structured matrix model and two stage-within-age matrix models for yellow perch. The stage-within-age versions both represented the young-of-the-year (YOY) stages, but differed in the timestep used for updating their density-dependent relationships (annual or daily). The predictions of the matrix models were first compared with the IBM under baseline conditions to confirm that parameter estimation of the matrix models was reasonable. We then simulated reduced and increased egg or adult survival in each model, and compared the relative responses among the four models. Predicted yellow perch spawner abundance under baseline conditions was similar among the IBM and two matrix models that used annual density-dependence, but underestimated by the stage-within-age matrix model that used daily density-dependence. Averaged annual abundances, YOY and yearling survival rates, and sizes at age were generally similar between the IBM and matrix models under baseline conditions. Density-dependent YOY survival was critical for accurately predicting yellow perch responses to changed egg and adult survival rates. Predicted responses to changed survival rates from the stage-within-age matrix model with daily density-dependence differed most from the IBM, and consistently predicted changes in juvenile stage survival opposite to those predicted by the other models. The matrix models that used annual density-dependence predicted similar abundance responses as the IBM to changed egg and adult survival rates. If sufficient data are available, we recommend a population and multispecies modeling approach. If data are available only for the species of interest, then we favor the stage-within-age matrix model with annual density-dependence because the stage structure for YOY allows for flexibility and because it performed better than other matrix models when compared to the IBM. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The sum of the environmental variance and the demographic covariance is the covariance between two individuals' contributions to the population growth within a year and corresponds to the coefficient of x2 in the expression for the variance of the change in population size. Hence, this coefficient may actually be negative. The demographic variance is the variance among individuals. It is shown that the definitions are consistent with use of these terms in models with additive effects and in diffusion approximations to population processes. The connection to classical birth and death processes, in which the environmental variance and demographic covariance is always zero, is discussed.

abstract = {In the past six decades, lifespan inequality has varied greatly within and among countries even while life expectancy has continued to increase. How and why does mortality change generate this diversity? We derive a precise link between changes in age-specific mortality and lifespan inequality, measured as the variance of age at death. Key to this relationship is a young-old threshold age, below and above which mortality decline respectively decreases and increases lifespan inequality. First, we show for Sweden that shifts in the threshold's location have modified the correlation between changes in life expectancy and lifespan inequality over the last two centuries. Second, we analyze the post-World War II (WWII) trajectories of lifespan inequality in a set of developed countries-Japan, Canada, and the United States-where thresholds centered on retirement age. Our method reveals how divergence in the age pattern of mortality change drives international divergence in lifespan inequality. Most strikingly, early in the 1980s, mortality increases in young U.S. males led to a continuation of high lifespan inequality in the United States; in Canada, however, the decline of inequality continued. In general, our wider international comparisons show that mortality change varied most at young working ages after WWII, particularly for males. We conclude that if mortality continues to stagnate at young ages yet declines steadily at old ages, increases in lifespan inequality will become a common feature of future demographic change.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Variation in lifespan has followed strikingly different trends for the young and old: while total lifespan variability has decreased as life expectancy at birth has risen, the variability conditional on survival to older ages has increased. These diverging trends reflect changes in the underlying demographic parameters determining age-specific mortality. OBJECTIVE We ask why the variation in the ages at death after survival to adult ages has followed a different trend than the variation at younger ages, and aim to explain the divergence in terms of the age pattern of historical mortality changes. METHODS Using simulations, we show that the empirical trends in lifespan variation are well characterized using the Siler model, which describes the mortality trajectory using functions representing early-life, later-life, and background mortality. We then obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the Siler parameters for Swedish females from 1900 to 2010. We express mortality in terms of a Markov chain model, and apply matrix calculus to compute the sensitivity of age- specific variance trends to the changes in Siler model parameters. RESULTS Our analysis quantifies the influence of changing demographic parameters on lifespan variability at all ages, highlighting the influence of declining childhood mortality on the reduction of lifespan variability, and the influence of subsequent improvements in adult survival on the rising variability of lifespans at older ages. CONCLUSIONS These findings provide insight into the dynamic relationship between the age pattern of survival improvements and time trends in lifespan variability.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Whereas it is well established that people with a lower socio-economic position have a shorter average lifespan, it is less clear what the variability surrounding these averages is. We set out to examine whether lower educated groups face greater variation in lifespans in addition to having a shorter life expectancy, in order to identify entry points for policies to reduce the impact of socio-economic position on mortality. METHODS We used harmonized, census-based mortality data from 10 European countries to construct life tables by sex and educational level (low, medium, high). Variation in lifespan was measured by the standard deviation conditional upon survival to age 35 years. We also decomposed differences between educational groups in lifespan variation by age and cause of death. RESULTS Lifespan variation was higher among the lower educated in every country, but more so among men and in Eastern Europe. Although there was an inverse relationship between average life expectancy and its standard deviation, the first did not completely predict the latter. Greater lifespan variation in lower educated groups was largely driven by conditions causing death at younger ages, such as injuries and neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS Lower educated individuals not only have shorter life expectancies, but also face greater uncertainty about the age at which they will die. More priority should be given to efforts to reduce the risk of an early death among the lower educated, e.g. by strengthening protective policies within and outside the health-care system.},

But within-group variance is large even in narrowly defined groups, and changes substantially and inversely with the group average length of life. We show that variance in length of life is inversely related to the Gompertz slope of log mortality through age, and we reveal its relationship to variance in a multiplicative frailty index.

@article{Bernardo1996,
abstract = {SYNOPSIS. Propagule size is perhaps the most widely recognized and studied maternal effect in ecology, yet its evolution is not well-understood. The large body of extant optimality theory treats parental investment solely as an ecological problem, largely from the perspective of progeny. This approach has had limited success explaining the ubiquitous variation in propagule size within and among natural populations at most temporal and spatial scales. This problem aside, an unassailable gap in propagule size theory is that it pays little heed to the fact that offspring size is a joint phenotype of two individuals- the offspring and its mother. Hence, the ecology of mothers is decidedly as important in shaping the evolution of propagule size phenotypes. There are two reasons to suspect that this gap may account for the lack of success of optimality theory to explain variation in nature. The first is that optimality models of propagule size make no allowance for, nor can they explain, widespread, multivariate correlations between maternal characters and clutch parameters, namely the positive phenotypic covariances of maternal age, size, fecundity, and per-propagule investment found in many organisms. If per-propagule investment is optimized by selection based on the expectation of offspring fitness, then why should that phenotype be a function of maternal age or size when the ecological circumstances of progeny are not changing as a function of maternal age or size? The second gap in current theory is that, like all optimization theory, it is patently non-genetic in that it is assumed that the phenotypes optimized are evolutionarily accessible. Recent maternal effects theory indicates that traits subject to maternal influence behave in unanticipated ways. Specifically, there may be time lags in response to selection, and hence, selection away from the optimum phenotype. This paper explores a suite of issues pertaining to the evolution of propagule size from the broader perspective of propagule size as a maternal effect (PSME) with a goal of widening the lens through which propagule size is viewed by evolutionary ecologists. Two themes are developed. First, I suggest that, to understand egg size variance and its implications for both maternal and offspring fitness, it is necessary to consider explicitly the ecological context in which a mother is producing eggs, not just that into which offspring will enter. I argue that some of the variables that have only been incorporated in pairwise fashion (or not at all) into studies of propagule size might account for the lack of agreement about how this important life history feature evolves. Further, I suggest that failure to consider other sources of selection on maternal phenotypes, driven by a narrow adaptationist view that has historically been taken of PSMEs, has obfuscated many interesting questions surrounding their coevolution with maternal characters. Thus, the second theme is that it is necessary to consider other explanations for why prop-agule size varies apart from those pertaining to offspring fitness per si. Based on a detailed review of the empirical literature, I conclude that the concept of an optimal propagule size is not only an insufficient construct to explain the evolution of propagule size, but that continued reliance on an optimization approach is likely to stifle development of more realistic and predictive theory for the evolution of this key life history trait. Novel theory should incorporate realities from physiology, development and genetics and should accommodate the dynamic nature of the selective environments in which propagule size evolves, all of which have been shown by empiricists to play a role in determining propagule size phenotypes. A key feature of this theory should be the explicit treatment of propagule size as a maternal effect.},

abstract = {Intrinsic growth rates often vary greatly among populations within a single species, implying that trade-offs with fast growth are present. It has been hypothesized that such a trade-off exists between growth rate and development rate. Growth-development trade-offs have been considered from observations of a negative correlation between growth and development rates among populations. In this study, we examined not only interpopulation but also intrapopulation correlations in a fish Oryzias latipes . Rearing experiments revealed that larvae from a high-latitude population grew faster but metamorphosed at larger sizes than larvae from a low-latitude population. Moreover, within each population, individuals that grew faster tended to delay metamorphosis. The parallelism of the negative interpopulation and intrapopulation correlations between growth and development rates strongly support a growth-development trade-off. Observations of swimming behaviors revealed that high-latitude, fast-growing juveniles showed lower steady-swimming and burst-swimming speeds, probably reflecting that their underdeveloped skeletal and muscular structures translated into the poorer swimming performances. These results suggest that the higher growth capacity of high-latitude O. latipes has evolved at the expense of fast development.},

abstract = {The hypothesis that the balance of trade-offs between survivorship, growth and reproductive allocation in the terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare will change when resource input is increased has been investigated experimentally. When the quality of food available was increased, by adding a mixture of litter from herbaceous dicotyledonous plants to a background low-quality food of dead grasses, survivorship was found to be the most phenotypically plastic trait, increasing by 168{\%}. Growth rates increased by 99{\%} but reproductive allocation by only 21{\%}. In the field, members of a population from a site with more high-quality food grew more than twice as fast as those from a site where less high-quality food was available. The population from the site with higher food availability, contrary to predictions from the laboratory study, did not survive as well as that from the site with less available high-quality food. This may be because the site that is more favourable for growth has a more stressful physical environment due to much bigger temperature fluctuations, which are known to be an important cause of mortality in this species. When individuals from both populations were reared under controlled laboratory conditions, both the parental and F1 generations from the poor growth environment survived better than those from the good growth habitat. However, even when given an excess of high-quality food those from the poor growth environment continued to grow more slowly and had a lower reproductive allocation than those from the site with higher food availability. We conclude that microevolutionary changes may have occurred in the balance of resource allocation between survivorship, growth and reproductive allocation, to favour higher survivorship during the longer prereproductive period at the site where growth to the threshold size for reproduction takes longer.},

abstract = {The effect of predation by the aquatic dipteran larva Chaoborus americanus on genetic diversity and life-history evolution in the cladoceran Daphnia pulex was investigated in large replicate laboratory populations. Instantaneous daily loss rates of clonal diversity and genetic variance for fitness indicate that 93-99{\%} of initial genetic diversity can be removed from populations during the 8-12 generations of clonal reproduction that occur each year in natural populations. In the absence of predation, the principal evolved changes in mean population life history were smaller immature body size and increased and earlier fecundity. In the presence of size-selective Chaoborus predation, populations evolved toward larger body size and increased and earlier reproduction. The difference between these two trajectories is an estimate of the direct additive effect of Chaoborus predation. This effect was manifested as evolution toward larger body size with a trend toward earlier and increased reproduction.},

abstract = {The study of optimal life histories involves the maximization of lifetime fitness but usually ignores the details of behavioral sequences. In contrast, the study of optimal behavioral sequences usually looks at the details of a sequence in isolation and not as part of the whole life history of the animal. The currency that is maximized is assumed to be related to lifetime fitness, but this relationship is rarely explored. In this paper we develop a common currency for behavioral decisions that is directly related to lifetime fitness. The common currency makes it possible to compare the benefits of qualitatively different behaviors. We show that many different costs can be used to explain a given behavioral sequence. Most of these costs have no biological interpretation. From these we single out a particular cost, the canonical cost, which measures the reduction in fitness that results from choosing a suboptimal action. Our general framework is illustrated by the example of a small bird in winter. We quantify the value of energy in terms of fitness and show how this value depends on energy reserves and time of day. As a result of this dependence, optimal foraging decisions depend on energy reserves and time of day, as does the optimal trade-off between foraging and looking around for predators.},

For the retrieval and processing of word-lists a single fronto-parietal network, including premotor, left prefrontal, left precuneal and left parietal regions, was activated.

abstract = {Do size and phylogeny affect patterns of covariation in life-history traits? If there are phylogenetic constraints on the evolution of life histories, do they differ from lineage to lineage? I applied principal component analysis and cluster analysis to two data sets - 65 mammal species (14 orders, 30 families, 10 traits) and 162 mammal species (22 orders, 64 families, 6 traits). In both data sets, most of the covariation in life-his- tory traits could be accounted for by the first two factors, and in both data sets their interpretation was similar. The first factor, accounting for 68-75{\%} of covariation of life-history traits, ranked the animals from early maturing, small, short-lived animals with short gestation periods, many small altricial young, and long lactation periods, to the opposite suite of traits in large animals. The second factor, accounting for 12-20{\%} of the covariation in life-history traits, ranked the animals from altricial to precocial. When order and family effects were removed, the proportion of variance accounted for by the first factor dropped 29-36{\%}, and the number of high-level clusters in- creased. Analysis within individual families revealed differences from lineage to lineage in the loadings of each trait on the first two principle factors. Weight alone accounts for much of the tendency for mammals to be arranged on a single axis ranging from early maturing, highly fecund, and short-lived small animals to the opposite. However, after the effects of weight were removed, order and family effects still had significant impact on patterns of covariation. Thus morphological design, in addition to size, may constrain life-history evolution. This explains why earlier workers saw clear patterns of covariation at high taxonomic levels whereas subsequent workers have found less covariation within species.},

We show that the choice of the ratio F/ alpha is arbitrary and is not grounded in demographic theory. We estimate the position on the slow-fast continuum using the first axis of a principal components analysis of all life-history variables studied by Oli and Dobson and show that most individual vital rates perform as well as the F/ alpha ratio. Finally, we find, in agreement with previous studies, that the age of first reproduction is a reliable predictor of the ranking of mammalian populations along the slow-fast continuum and that both body mass and phylogeny markedly influence the generation time of mammalian species. We conclude that arbitrary ratios such as F/ alpha correlate with life-history types in mammals simply because life-history variables are highly correlated in response to allometric, phylogenetic, and environmental influences. We suggest that generation time is a reliable metric to measure life-history variation among mammalian populations and should be preferred to any arbitrary combination between vital rates.},

Using life-history data for 142 natural populations of mam-mals, we estimated the elasticity of l to changes in age at maturity (a), age at last reproduction (q), juvenile survival (P j), adult survival (P a), and fertility (F). Elasticities were then used to quantify the relative importance of a, q, P j , P a , and F to l and to test theoretical predictions regarding the relative influence on l of changes in life-history variables. Neither a nor any other single life-history variable had the largest relative influence on l in the majority of the pop-ulations, and this pattern did not change substantially when effects of phylogeny and body size were statistically removed. Empirical support for theoretical predictions was poor at best. However, anal-yses of elasticities on the basis of the magnitude (F) and onset (a) of reproduction revealed that a, followed by F, had the largest relative influence on l in populations characterized by early maturity and high reproductive rates, or when . When maturity was F/a 1 0.60 delayed and reproductive rates were low, or when , survival F/a ! 0.15 rates were overwhelmingly most influential, and reproductive pa-rameters (a and F) had little relative influence on l.

Castration, which removes the source of male sex hormones, prolongs male lifespan in many animals, but this issue has been debated in humans [3]. To examine the effects of castration on longevity, we analyzed the lifespan of historical Korean eunuchs. Korean eunuchs preserved their lineage by adopting castrated boys. We studied the genealogy records of Korean eunuchs and determined the lifespan of 81 eunuchs. The average lifespan of eunuchs was 70.0 ± 1.76 years, which was 14.4-19.1 years longer than the lifespan of non-castrated men of similar socio-economic status.

abstract = {The identification of patterns in life-history strategies across the tree of life is essential to our prediction of population persistence, extinction, and diversification. Plants exhibit a wide range of patterns of longevity, growth, and reproduction, but the general determinants of this enormous variation in life history are poorly understood. We use demographic data from 418 plant species in the wild, from annual herbs to supercentennial trees, to examine how growth form, habitat, and phylogenetic relationships structure plant life histories and to develop a framework to predict population performance. We show that 55{\%} of the variation in plant life-history strategies is ade-quately characterized using two independent axes: the fast–slow continuum, including fast-growing, short-lived plant species at one end and slow-growing, long-lived species at the other, and a repro-ductive strategy axis, with highly reproductive, iteroparous species at one extreme and poorly reproductive, semelparous plants with frequent shrinkage at the other. Our findings remain consistent across major habitats and are minimally affected by plant growth form and phylogenetic ancestry, suggesting that the relative inde-pendence of the fast–slow and reproduction strategy axes is general in the plant kingdom. Our findings have similarities with how life-history strategies are structured in mammals, birds, and reptiles. The position of plant species populations in the 2D space produced by both axes predicts their rate of recovery from disturbances and population growth rate. This life-history framework may comple-ment trait-based frameworks on leaf and wood economics; to-gether these frameworks may allow prediction of responses of plants to anthropogenic disturbances and changing environments. life history strategy | iteroparity | generation time | matrix population model | phylogenetic signal D emographic schedules of survival, growth, and reproduction, which comprise life-history strategies, are fundamental to our understanding of a range of ecological and evolutionary processes, such as invasions and local extinctions (1–3), com-munity structure (4, 5), and species diversification (6, 7). Con-sequently, the development and careful testing of theory on how organisms allocate resources to survival, growth, and reproduction are important goals for evolutionary biology, ecology, and conser-vation biology (8). Indeed, calls for the development of a " periodic table " to classify species based on their life-history strategies and to predict population dynamics and community composition go back to the early development of evolutionary biology as a discipline (9). A main axiom of life-history theory is that trade-offs (i.e., bud-getary compromises) between different aspects of an organism's demographic schedules, such as survival, growth, and/or re-production, constrain and optimize the range of possible life-history strategies that can evolve across the tree of life (10, 11). However, the plant kingdom encompasses a vast amount of life-history variation; plant longevity, for instance, ranges from weeks to millennia (12). Many plant species' life cycles include cryptic life stages such as seedbanks (13) or dormant adults (similar to animal hibernation) (14). Reproduction also can be highly vari-able among plants, with seed mass and per-capita seed pro-duction ranging across six orders of magnitude (15). Previous classifications of plant life-history strategies have been limited in geographic (16, 17), taxonomic, and phylogenetic scales (17) and in the ability to differentiate life-history trade-offs (17–19). Here we propose an approach analogous to that developed decades ago for vertebrates (20) to study the drivers behind plant life-history variation. We combine demographic, phylogenetic, and ecological data from natural populations of 418 plant species worldwide (Fig. 1) to address the following questions: (i) What are the main axes of variation of plant life-history strategies? (ii) To what extent do phylogenetic ancestry, habitat, growth form, and size constrain plant life-history variation? We then test whether the position of a species on these axes predicts two important metrics of population performance: population growth rate and speed of recovery from disturbances. If clear patterns emerge, they may form the basis for a satisfactory classification and predictive},

One fundamental prediction from the theory is that long-lived species should be restrictive in any increase of their current investment. It has been suggested that long-lived species, therefore, have evolved a fixed level of investment in young in order to maximize their own adult survival. However, recent experimental studies have shown that long-lived seabirds have a flexible reproductive performance and adjust their effort in raising young, both according to their own body condition and to the need of the chicks. In this study, we present a model of the optimal balance between reproductive effort and adult survival for long-lived birds breeding in a stochastic environment. During poor breeding conditions, maximum fitness is achieved either by not breeding at all, or by abandoning the brood. Beyond a certain threshold in breeding conditions, there is a steep increase in reproductive effort and an equally steep decrease in adult survival. The model is applied to two hypothetical long-lived seabirds differing in their potential fecundity. For the genotype with a potentially high fecundity, the model predicts a high threshold for breeding (i.e., breeding conditions need to be very good for the species to attempt breeding); above the threshold, the value of reproduction in terms of fitness is high. For the genotype with potentially low fecundity, the model predicts a low threshold for breeding, and the value of reproduction in terms of fitness is low. By increasing clutch size in the model, we examine the optimal response of the two genotypes to an experimental brood size manipulation. For both genotypes, the model predicts that the threshold for breeding is lower among controls than among enlarged broods, giving a range of possible outcomes of the experiment depending on breeding conditions. The few studies on brood enlargements in long-lived species carried out so far may support the predictions from the model.},

abstract = {Because it modulates the fitness returns of possible options of energy expenditure at each ontogenetic stage, environmental stochasticity is usually considered a selective force in driving or constraining possible life histories. Divergent regimes of environmental fluctuation experienced by populations are expected to generate differences in the resource allocation schedule between survival and reproductive effort and outputs. To our knowledge, no study has previously examined how different regimes of stochastic variation in environmental conditions could result in changes in both the temporal variation and mean of demographic parameters, which could then lead to intraspecific variation along the slow–fast continuum of life history tactics. To investigate these issues, we used capture–recapture data collected on five populations of a long-lived amphibian (Bombina variegata) experiencing two distinct levels of stochastic environmental variation: (1) constant availability of breeding sites in space and time (predictable environment), and (2) variable spatio-temporal availability of breeding sites (unpredictable environment). We found that female breeding propensity varied more from year to year in unpredictable than in predictable environments. Although females in unpredictable environments produced on average more viable offspring per year, offspring production was more variable between years. Survival at each ontogenetic stage was slightly lower and varied significantly more from year to year in unpredictable environments. Taken together, these results confirm that increased environmental stochasticity can modify the resource allocation schedule between survival and reproductive effort and outputs and may lead to intraspecific variation along the slow–fast continuum of life history tactics.},

abstract = {Mammalian life histories can be ordered along a slow-fast continuum from slow-developing, long-lived species with low reproductive rates at one end to rapidly developing, short-lived species with high reproductive rates at the other. Body size and mortality rate are strong correlates of the slow-fast axis, whereby juvenile and adult mortality rates correlate positively but are linked to certain life-history traits with differing strengths. The strong covariation of life-history traits renders it difficult to evaluate the adaptive value of single life-history elements. Species that deviate from the common pattern might help to identify specific selected strategies. Caviomorph rodents show an unusual combination of life-history traits. Like slowliving mammals, they produce few precocial young after long gestation periods, but they have the early maturation potential of their fast-living counterparts. This combination of life-history traits suggests low levels of juvenile mortality but high adult mortality rates, and thus an unusually low ratio of juvenile to adult mortality compared to other small mammals. To test these predictions, we modelled age-specific survival probabilities using capture-recapture data from a wild population of Cavia magna. Patterns of age-specific survival rates were in accordance with the predictions, but atypical for small mammals. Levels of adult survival were low, and comparable to those of much smaller rodent species. Juvenile survival probabilities were high relative to those reported for other small mammals and reached adult levels after only 1 month. The ratio of adult to early juvenile survival depended strongly on the date of birth. Whereas survival of young from the first birth cohort in spring did not differ from that of adults, early survivorship of later cohorts was lower. Our results fit expectations from life-history theory and suggest that high levels of adult mortality selected for the early onset of reproduction in wild cavies. The comparatively low juvenile mortalities are probably a consequence of the precocial state of the cavy offspring. We suggest that the reproductive strategy of cavies represents a different solution to the trade-off between fecundity and juvenile survival compared to altricial small mammals},

abstract = {When environmental conditions vary stochastically, individuals accrue fitness benefits by exhibiting phenotypic plasticity. Here we analyze a general dynamic-programming model describing an individual's optimal energy allocation in a stochastic environment. After maturation, individuals repeatedly decide how to allocate incoming energy between reproduction and maintenance. We analyze the optimal fraction of energy invested in reproduction and the resultant degree of plasticity in dependence on environmental variability and predictability. Our analyses reveal unexpected patterns of optimal energy allocation. When energy availability is low, all energy is allocated to reproduction, although this implies that individuals will not survive after reproduction. Above a certain threshold of energy availability, the optimal reproductive investment decreases to a minimum and even vanishes entirely in highly variable environments. With further improving energy availability, optimal reproductive investment gradually increases again. Costs of plasticity affect this allocation pattern only quantitatively. Our results show that optimal reproductive investment does not increase monotonically with growing energy availability and that small changes in energy availability can lead to major variations in optimal energy allocation. Our results help to unify two apparently opposing predictions from life-history theory, that organisms should increase reproductive investment both with improved environmental conditions and when conditions deteriorate ("terminal investment").},

We use a model system, the wing dimorphic cricket, Gryllus firmus as a case study to test the assumptions and predictions of the Y model.

abstract = {While it is commonly believed that animals live longer in zoos than in the wild, this assumption has rarely been tested. We compared four survival metrics (longevity, baseline mortality, onset of senescence and rate of senescence) between both sexes of free-ranging and zoo populations of more than 50 mammal species. We found that mammals from zoo populations generally lived longer than their wild counterparts (84{\%} of species). The effect was most notable in species with a faster pace of life (i.e. a short life span, high reproductive rate and high mortality in the wild) because zoos evidently offer protection against a number of relevant conditions like predation, intraspecific competition and diseases. Species with a slower pace of life (i.e. a long life span, low reproduction rate and low mortality in the wild) benefit less from captivity in terms of longevity; in such species, there is probably less potential for a reduction in mortality. These findings provide a first general explanation about the different magnitude of zoo environment benefits among mammalian species, and thereby highlight the effort that is needed to improve captive conditions for slow-living species that are particularly susceptible to extinction in the wild.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the energy requirements of pregnant and lactating women consistent with optimal pregnancy outcome and adequate milk production. DESIGN: Total energy cost of pregnancy was estimated using the factorial approach from pregnancy-induced increments in basal metabolic rate measured by respiratory calorimetry or from increments in total energy expenditure measured by the doubly labelled water method, plus energy deposition attributed to protein and fat accretion during pregnancy. SETTING: Database on changes in basal metabolic rate and total energy expenditure during pregnancy, and increments in protein based on measurements of total body potassium, and fat derived from multi-compartment body composition models was compiled. Energy requirements during lactation were derived from rates of milk production, energy density of human milk, and energy mobilisation from tissues. SUBJECTS: Healthy pregnant and lactating women. RESULTS: The estimated total cost of pregnancy for women with a mean gestational weight gain of 12.0 kg, was 321 or 325 MJ, distributed as 375, 1200, 1950 kJ day(-1), for the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. For exclusive breastfeeding, the energy cost of lactation was 2.62 MJ day(-1) based on a mean milk production of 749 g day(-1), energy density of milk of 2.8 kJ g(-1), and energetic efficiency of 0.80. In well-nourished women, this may be subsidised by energy mobilisation from tissues on the order of 0.72 MJ day(-1), resulting in a net increment of 1.9 MJ day(-1) over non-pregnant, non-lactating energy requirements. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for energy intake of pregnant and lactating women should be updated based on recently available data.},

abstract = {Allocation of resources to current reproduction may reduce future reproduction, growth, and survival, but individual heterogeneity in resource acquisition may obscure this fitness cost. In capital breeders, heterogeneity in reproductive success is often related to body mass or condition, underlining the importance of stored reserves for reproduction. Heterogeneity in the rate of resource acquisition could also affect reproduction. Resource acquisition depends on food intake, but the effects of individual foraging rate on mass gain and reproductive success in wild herbivorous mammals are unknown. We measured how individual bite rate affected mass change and reproductive success of 55 female eastern gray kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) over 2 years. Females with faster bite rate had greater subsequent mass gain, leading to greater offspring survival. In one of 2 years, bite rate directly increased juvenile survival to 8 months. Bite rate appeared to have a direct effect on survival to weaning for young born to females with above-average mass gain, particularly for females in better body condition. Independent of bite rate, individual mass change explained most of the variation in offspring survival. We found a weak positive effect of body condition on reproductive success, suggesting that condition affected reproductive success through its effect on mass change and bite rate. Kangaroos appeared to combine income and capital breeding strategies to deal with internal and external constraints on resource allocation. Our study underlines the importance of accounting for different sources of individual heterogeneity that may affect trade-offs among life-history traits, with important consequences for population dynamics and the evolution of reproductive strategies.},

abstract = {1. In a rapidly changing world, understanding and predicting population change is a central aim of applied ecologists, and this involves studying the links between environmental variation and vital rates (survival, fecundity, etc.). Demographic analysis and modelling can be daunting for practicing ecologists, and here we provide an overview of some of the most important issues and methods. 2. Collection of demographic data should follow standardized protocols and the statistical power to detect links with environment is critically dependent on long time-series. Candidate environmental covariates should be carefully selected with a view to reducing the risk of spurious correlations. The relevant sample size for environment–demography links is typically the number of years and mixed models with random year effects offer a powerful framework to enforce this. 3. Data on individually marked animals are the best source of information on demography. These data can be analysed and demographic parameters estimated using a wide variety of capture–mark–recapture models, available in standard software packages. 4. Population models integrate all demographic variables and provide estimates of population growth rate. Two common classes of models are matrix models and integrated population models, where the latter combine parameter estimation and dynamic modelling. 5. Synthesis and applications.Careful demographic analysis and modelling has provided solutions for many real-world problems in population management, as well as assisting the development of general principles. The tools currently available are flexible and powerful, and the main limitations to their more general use are data availability and training.},

I used the ratio of fertility rate to age at first reproduction (F/$\alpha$ ratio) to quantify the tempo of life-history of 138 populations of mammals, and investigated the life-history and population-dynamic consequences of being "fast" or "slow". "Fast" mammals (F/$\alpha${\textgreater}0.60) were characterized by early maturity, short lifespans, low survival rates, and high fertility and projected population growth rate ($\lambda$) compared to "slow" (F/$\alpha${\textless}0.15) mammals. In "fast" populations, $\lambda$ was overwhelmingly most sensitive to changes in reproductive parameters (age at first reproduction and fertility rates) and relatively insensitive to changes in survival rates. In "slow" populations, $\lambda$ was very sensitive to changes in juvenile or adult survival rates, and relatively insensitive to changes in reproductive parameters. The pattern of relationships between the F/$\alpha$ ratio and life-history variables, $\lambda$, and elasticity of $\lambda$ to changes in life-history variables persisted even after the effects of body size and phylogeny were statistically removed. These results suggest that fast-slow continuum in mammalian life-history is independent of body size or phylogeny, that the F/$\alpha$ ratio adequately quantifies the position of a population along a fast-slow continuum, and that the tempo of life-histories has substantial population-dynamic consequences. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

The classification is motivated by models of the timing of growth and reproduction in annual organisms, but applies to any model in which the population is unstructured at some convenient annual census time. During the season an organism makes a sequence of discrete behavioural choices. Each choice can be based on time in the season, any aspects of the organism's state, such as its size or energy reserves, and current environmental conditions. The organism may be subject to sources of demographic stochasticity that act independently on different population members. There may also be a source of environmental stochasticity, such as weather conditions that cause the environment as a whole to fluctuate. The classification of models given here is based on the types of stochasticity that act. I identify those models where the optimal strategy can be found simply by employing a dynamic optimization technique such as dynamic programming. For problems that are not solvable in this way, I outline other approaches that can be used to find a solution.},

The imperative for an animal to meet these costs within the energetic constraints of the environment drives many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, yet has largely been overlooked in traditional ecological paradigms. The field of 'ecological energetics' is bringing comparative physiology out of the laboratory and, for the first time, is becoming broadly accessible to field ecologists addressing real-world questions at many spatial and temporal scales. In an era of unprecedented global environmental challenges, ecological energetics opens up the tantalising prospect of a more predictive, mechanistic understanding of the drivers of threatened species decline, delivering process-based modelling approaches to natural resource management. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Bioenergetics is used as the mechanistic foundation of many models of fishes. As the context of a model gradually extends beyond pure bioenergetics to include behaviour, life-history traits and function and performance of the entire organism, so does the need for complementing bioenergetic measurements with trade-offs, particularly those dealing with survival. Such a broadening of focus revitalized and expanded the domain of behavioural ecology in the 1980s. This review makes the case that a similar change of perspective is required for physiology to contribute to the types of predictions society currently demands, e.g. regarding climate change and other anthropogenic stressors.},

I first derive the two canonical equations of SDP. These are valuable because although they apply to no system in particular, they share commonalities with many systems (as do frictionless springs). After that, I show how we used SDP in insect behavioral ecology. I describe the puzzles that needed to be solved, the SDP equations we used to solve the puzzles, and the experiments that we used to test the predictions of the models. I then briefly describe two other applications of SDP in biology: first, understanding the developmental pathways followed by steelhead trout in California and second skipped spawning by Norwegian cod. In both cases, modeling and empirical work were closely connected. I close with lessons learned and advice for the young mathematical biologists.},

abstract = {The life history attributes which maximize fitness can be established analytically through Fisher's equation for reproductive value. Maximizing the reproductive value at age zero is equivalent to maximizing the ultimate rate of increase. As an example of the usefulness of this equality it is shown that when survivorship is uniformly reduced, the corresponding optimal maternal frequency is unaltered, even though the ultimate rate of increase is lowered by a known amount. A general life history model is proposed which links these demographic determinants of rate of increase with the energy utilization alternatives (as among maintenance, growth, and reproduction) characterizing an individual organism's development. Since the energy partitioning alternatives at any age may depend on previous allocations, an organism state variable is introduced to describe the domain over which the maximization of reproductive value may take place. Further, if the reproductive value is to be a maximum at age zero, it must be maximized at every age. An optimal life history, then, is characterized by the energy allocations which maximize sequential reproductive values. Further examples of the utility of the model focus on growth vs reproduction decisions under biomass specific life history attributes. It is shown that if births per unit energy is a linear or convex function, then an organism will not simultaneously grow and reproduce. Determinant growth, biomass at first reproduction, and explicit calculation of the maximum ultimate rate of increase are also illustrated. {\textcopyright} 1974.},

I develop a simple architectural model for G for two traits under directional selection constrained by their dependence on a common limiting resource. I assume that genetic variance is maintained by mutation-selection balance. The relative numbers of loci that play a role in acquiring versus allocating a limiting resource play a crucial role in determining genetic covariance. If many loci are involved in acquiring a resource, genetic covariance may be either negative or positive at equilibrium, depending on the fitness function and the input of mutational variance. The form of G does not necessarily reveal the constraint on resource acquisition inherent in the system, and therefore studies estimating G do not test for the existence of life-history tradeoffs. Characters may evolve in patterns that are unpredictable from G. Experiments are suggested that would indicate if this model could explain observations of positive genetic covariance.},

abstract = {Researchers studying the adaptive significance of behaviour typically assume that genetic mechanisms will not inhibit evolutionary trajectories, an assumption commonly known as the 'phenotypic gambit'. Although the phenotypic gambit continues to be a useful heuristic for behavioural ecology, here we discuss how genomic methods provide new tools and conceptual approaches that are relevant to behavioural ecology. We first describe how the concept of a genetic toolkit for behaviour can allow behavioural ecologists to synthesize both genomic and ecological information when assessing behavioural adaptation. Then we show how gene expression profiles can be viewed as complex phenotypic measurements, used to (1) predict behaviour, (2) evaluate phenotypic plasticity and (3) devise methods to manipulate behaviour in order to test adaptive hypotheses. We propose that advances in genomics and bioinformatics may allow researchers to overcome some of the logistical obstacles that motivated the inception of the phenotypic gambit. Behavioural ecology and genomics are mutually informative, providing potential synergy that could lead to powerful advances in the field of animal behaviour. ?? 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Evolutionary theory is primarily concerned with genetic processes, yet empirical testing of this theory often involves data collected on phenotypes. To make this tenable, the implicit assumption is often made that phenotypic patterns are good predictors of genetic patterns; an assumption that coined the phenotypic gambit. Although this assumption has been validated for traits with high heritability, such as morphology, its generality for traits with low heritabilities, such as life-history and behavioural traits, remains controversial. Using a large-scale cross-fostering experiment, we were able to measure genetic, common environmental and phenotypic correlations between four colour traits and two skeletal traits in a wild population of passerine birds, the blue tit (Parus caeruleus). Colour traits had little heritable variation but common environment effects were found to be important; skeletal traits showed the opposite pattern. Positive correlations because of a shared natal environment were found between all traits, obscuring negative genetic correlations between some colour and skeletal traits. Consequently, phenotypic patterns were poor surrogates for genetic patterns and we suggest that this may be common if trade-offs or substantial parental effects exist. For this group of traits, the phenotypic gambit cannot be made and we suggest caution when inferring genetic patterns from phenotypic data, especially for behavioural and life-history traits},

abstract = {Theory concerning the evolution of life history (the schedule of reproduction and survival) focuses on describing the life history which maximises fitness. Although there is an intuitive link between life history and fitness, there are in fact several measures of the 'black box' concept of fitness. There has been a debate in the bio-mathematical literature on the predictive difference between the two most commonly used measures; intrinsic rate of increase r and net reproductive ratio R0. Although both measures aim to describe fitness, models using one of the measures may predict the opposite of similar models using the other measure, which is clearly undesirable. Here, I review the evolution of these fitness measures over the last four decades, the predictive differences between these measures and the resulting shift of the fitness concept. I focus in particular on some recent developments, which have solved the dilemma of predictive differences between these fitness measures by explicitly acknowledging the game-theoretical nature of life-history evolution.},

abstract = {Abstract Our research aims to further knowledge on the adaptive significance of reproductive processes in female primates, using a comparative approach. Our studies in semi-free ranging olive baboons (Papio anubis) show that sampled baboon mothers resume cycling and reconceive when their infants reach a relatively constant threshold mass, as predicted from interspecies life history theory. We suggest that the duration of maternal investment acted as a facultative adjustment to infant growth rates, and depends on the maternal physical and social characteristics (e.g. body mass and social rank). Energetic costs associated with reproduction are surprisingly low in our sample. Energy intake and energy expenditure do not closely pre- dict the time to resumption of cycling.We also find a posi- tive correlation between maternal energy expenditure and infant growth rates. Using the baboon model, this study places these results on infant growth and reproductive ener- getics into a broader perspective on primate life history, and explores the question of how costly non-human pri- mate infants are. We have divided these expenditures into time and energy costs, investigating each of these during the early phase of growth.},

abstract = {Reproductive effort in female ungulates originates from gestation and lactation and has been studied extensively; however, no comparable studies of reproductive effort in males (due to fighting for access to mates) have, to our knowledge, previously been reported. Here, we report on weight loss of male red deer during the annual mating season--a direct measure of male reproductive effort (or somatic reproductive costs). The 'terminal investment' hypothesis predicts that reproductive effort should increase with age, given that costs remain stable. We also propose the 'mating strategy-effort' hypothesis, which predicts that reproductive effort peaks in prime-aged males, since they are most often the harem holders. Consistent with the mating strategy-effort hypothesis, relative weight loss during the rutting season peaked at prime age and was lower in younger and senescent males. Weight loss during the rut was relatively smaller as density increased and more so for older males. This is probably primarily due to males (particularly senescent males) starting their rut in poorer condition at high density. The pattern of reproductive effort in males with regard to age and density therefore differs markedly from the pattern reported for females.},

abstract = {The theory of r- and K-selection was one of the first predictive models for life-history evolution. It helped to galvanize the empirical field of comparative life-history and dominated thinking on the subject from the late 1960s through the 1970s. Large quantities of field data were collected that claimed to test predictions of the theory. By the early 1980s, sentiment about the theory had changed so completely that a proposal to test it or the use of it to interpret empirical results would likely be viewed as archaic and naive. The theory was displaced,by demographic models that concentrated on mortality patterns as the cause of life-history evolution. Although demographic models are known for their density-independent approach and focus on extrinsic mortality, these models can incorporate many ecological features captured by r- and K-selection, such as density-dependent population regulation, resource availability, and environmental fluctuations. We highlight the incorporation of these factors in recent theory, then show how they are manifest in our research on life-history evolution in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Explanations of the repeatable suites of life-history differences across populations of guppies originate from demographic models of predator-driven age-specific mortality. Recently, careful examination of guppy demography and habitat has revealed that density-dependent regulation and resource availability may have influenced the evolution of guppy life histories. In the field, these factors covary with predation risk; however, they can be uncoupled experimentally, providing insight into how they may have synergistically driven guppy life-history evolution. Although life-history theory has shifted away from a focus on r- and K-selection, the themes of density-dependent regulation, resource availability, and environmental fluctuations are integral to current demographic theory and are potentially important in any natural system},

abstract = {Studies of life histories often compare species to discern patterns in the evolution of traits. Major components of life histories appear to involve important aspects of species biology, and the first such component appears to be body size. We tested whether the second major component of variation in life histories of mammals is a continuum from species with short lives to long lives, the “fast–slow continuum.” Mammalian populations (n = 143) representing 109 species were examined, and life histories were summarized using 5 key variables that reflect reproduction and survival. Body size and phylogeny were significant influences on life histories. Once these influences were removed statistically, a major axis of life history variation that reflected the fast–slow continuum was revealed in a principal components analysis. This component of life history was poorly but significantly associated with indices of the fast–slow continuum, such as the ratio of reproduction to age at maturity and generation time. Fast and slow species were identified among several orders and families of mammals, and one species exhibited fast and slow populations. These results may indicate that fast and slow life cycles are highly phenotypically plastic. Degree of precociality did not appear to be a third major component of life histories.},

To test the hypothesis that reproductive success and the costs of reproduction vary according to mass and population density, we analyzed 25 yr of data on bighorn ewes (Ovis canadensis). The number of adult females was first limited by yearly removals, then allowed to triple. We found no survival costs of reproduction for ewes aged 4-7 yr. For ewes aged 8-14 yr, survival was density dependent for barren ewes but not for ewes that weaned lambs. Failure to lamb was rare and negatively correlated with fertility the following year. At low population density, lactation had a negative effect on mass gain but had a limited reproductive cost. At high density, heavy ewes had higher reproductive success than light ewes, and the reproductive cost and somatic costs of reproduction increased. The cost of reproduction was greater for light than for heavy ewes. Survival of weaned lambs to 1 yr was affected by population density but not by maternal mass or previous reproductive success. In large mammals, manipulations of reproductive effort are problematic, but long-term monitoring of individual mass and reproductive success under varying conditions of resource availability can provide insights into the evolution of life histories},

Most of the fruits that fail to mature are abscised from 2-5 wk after the flowering period.

The pattern of fruit abscission was examined in relation to the principal herbivore. Field observations and experiments show: (1) the larger the infructescence, the higher the probability that a given fruit will abort; (2) branches that have expe-rienced simulated herbivory have significantly more abortions than control branches; (3) if one fruit is aborted from an infructescence, the remaining fruits have a higher probability of maturing; (4) fruits accumulate {\textless}10{\%} of their mature dry weight and total protein during the 1st 5 wk of growth and the remaining 90W in the next 4 wk (after the period of abortion). These data suggest that (1) each branch supplies the energy necessary to mature the fruits that it bears, (2) environmental stress, especially herbivory, reduces the resources available for fruit production, (3) fruit abortion is a response to limited resources, and (4) the pattern of fruit growth reduces the "cost" of abortion. The overall pattern of fruit reduction is interpreted as an adaptive trade-off between seed number and seed quality which permits the parent plant to match fruit production with available resources.},

abstract = {There are strong theoretical reasons for expecting the evolution of an adaptive control of offspring production in relation to their quality and sex, but little empirical evidence that it exists (Williams 1979; Clutton-Brock and Albon 1982). Data from a 12-yr study of coypu reproductive biology suggest that adaptive control may exist in this species and that one mechanism is the selective abortion of entire litters. Young females, in better than average physical condition and expected to litter in the summer, abort small litters of predominantly female embryos at around wk 13-14 of the 19-wk gestation period. Large litters and small, predominantly male litters are retained, and parturition follows normally. Females conceive soon after selective abortion, and the new litter is significantly larger than that aborted: about 5.82 (± 2.07 SD) as opposed to about 4.17 (± 1.74). Neonate size is positively correlated with female condition (and body size) and inversely related to litter size. The differences in body size at birth are carried through to differences in adult size. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that when females are in above-average condition, it would pay them to invest preferentially in offspring of the sex whose chances of future RS will benefit most (Trivers and Willard 1973). Males would be expected to benefit most in the coypu and other species that have polygynous mating systems. Females that abort small, predominantly female litters (with large embryos) abandon offspring that would continue to be costly during the last 6 wk of pregnancy and during the 8-wk lactation period but that would pay off, in fitness terms, little better than small females; instead, they invest their large fat reserves in the production of a larger litter.},

This surprisingly high subtropical carbon uptake cannot be fully accounted for by sediment trap-collected sinking particles and the downward mixing of suspended and dissolved organic carbon. We propose an explanation for these paradoxical observations: gel-like organic matter rich in carbon but poor in nutrients, akin to transparent exopolymer particles, is produced by phytoplankton under nutrient limitation, and a portion sinks into the shallow subsurface, where it is respired by heterotrophic bacteria. This organic matter would evade detection by sediment traps, effectively representing an additional (sinking-driven) source of dissolved organic carbon to the subsurface. Building on existing evidence for the production of such nutrient-poor organic matter in surface waters, we describe evidence for its decomposition in the shallow subsurface of the Sargasso Sea.

abstract = {JMnsson, K. I. 1997. Capital and income breeding as alternative tactics of resource use in reproduction. -Oikos 78: 57-66. In order to compensate for the resource demands of reproduction, organisms usually increase the amount of total food resources available. This may be achieved by different tactics of resource use that also include foraging decisions. Two such general tactics are discussed in this paper under the concepts of capital and income breeding. These are defined mainly from the temporal distribution of resource acquisition relative to resource use. A capital breeder acquires its resources in advance and store them endogenously or exogenously until they are needed to supply aspects of offspring production. An income breeder, on the other hand, adjusts its food intake concurrently with breeding, without reliance on stores. In a perfectly predictable environment without limited resources, income breeding is the best option since capital breeders may have to pay a number of energetic and demographic costs for their stored resources. However, under unpredictable food conditions, food/time limitations, and risky foraging conditions, capital breeding offers many benefits. The costing systems (pre-or postbreeding costs) induced by capital and income breeding will largely influence the opportunity for these energetic tactics to evolve. While capital and income breeders may potentially experience both pre-and postbreeding costs, capital breeders may be more exposed to prebreeding costs due to predation in connection with acquisition and carriage of stores. The ways that organisms use their food resources have important consequences for their fitness. As a first classification, problems of resource use may be divided into the acquisition of resources, and allocation of these to different organism functions. Of these two aspects, questions about allocation have received much more attention from life history ecologists than questions about acquisition. This is probably due to the strong impact of the reproductive effort theory (Williams 1966, Schaffer 1974, Charlesworth 1980) which analyses the demographic consequences of allocation of already acquired resources to somatic versus reproductive func-tions, without consideration of acquisition aspects. The need for an integration of the theories of optimal foraging and life history evolution was indicated},

He argued that much of the mortality in the temperate zones is relatively independent of the genotype (and phenotype) of the organism concerned, and has little to do with the size of the population. Traditional examples of mass winter kills of fish and sparrows are extremes of this sort. Dobzhansky reasoned that in the relatively constant tropics, most mortality is more directed, generally favoring those individuals with better competitive abilities. Thus, in the temperate zones selection often favors high fecundity and rapid development, wheras in the tropics lower fecundity and slower development could act to increase competitive ability. By putting more energy into each offspring and producing fewer total offspring, overall individual fitness is increased. The small clutch sizes characteristic of many tropical birds are consistent with Dobzhansky's hypothesis. Dobzhansky's ideas were framed in terms too specific to reach the general ecological audience and have gone more or less unnoticed until fairly recently},

abstract = {Female aspic vipers (Vipera aspis) are "capital breeders," and delay reproduction until they have amassed large energy reserves. Data from an eight-year mark-recapture study on free-ranging vipers suggest that potential costs of reproduction were high for these animals, in terms of survival as well as growth and energy storage. Females that reproduced experienced higher mortality rates than nonreproductive females and, hence, exhibited a tendency toward semelparity, grew less, and devoted most of their energy stores to reproduction. Both the depletion of body reserves and the low Survival of reproductive females translated into significant costs (decrements of lifetime reproductive success [LRS]). However, the cessation of growth during pregnancy had no detectable effect on LRS. Most females produced only a single litter during their lifetimes. A female's "costs" in energy terms were not negatively correlated with her future reproductive output, probably because female vipers vary considerably in the rate at which they can accumulate energy. This notion is supported by the observations that (1) females with higher initial body reserves expended more energy during reproduction, and (2) females that accumulated energy more rapidly after parturition were more likely to survive and to breed again. This kind of variation among females masks any underlying trade-off between current reproductive effort and probable future reproductive success. Despite this complication, a strong link between rates of survival and postreproductive mass recovery suggests that changes in body reserves govern reproductive effort in this species.},

An influential theoretical prediction states that organisms should increasingly invest in reproduction as they approach the end of their life. An apparent mismatch of empirical data with this prediction has been attributed to age-related constraints on the ability to reproduce. Here we present a general framework for the evolution of age-related reproductive trajectories. Instead of characterizing an organism by its age, we characterize it by its physiological condition. We develop a common currency that if maximized at each time guarantees the whole life history is optimal. This currency integrates reproduction, mortality and changes in condition. We predict that under broad conditions it will be optimal for organisms to invest less in reproduction as they age, thus challenging traditional interpretations of age-related traits and renewing debate about the extent to which observed life histories are shaped by constraint versus adaptation. Our analysis gives a striking illustration of the differences between an age-based and a condition-based approach to life-history theory. It also provides a unified account of not only standard life-history models but of related models involving the allocation of limited resources. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society},

abstract = {SENESCENCE is the innate deterioration of an organism that leads to a decline in its fitness components such as fecundity and survival expectations with advancing age1,2. Williams3 proposed that the evolution of senescence could be understood in terms of age-specific pleiotropic gene action, where a mutation increases fitness early in life at the expense of reducing it later on. The basic idea, first proposed by Medawar1, is that mutations acting early in life are more sensitive to selection than those acting later, as the early effects would be expressed in more individuals than would the late effects. A cost of reproduction, where an increase in reproductive rate reduces future survival or fecundity, could be the kind of pleiotropic gene action that generates senescence2,3. Evidence exists for such costs in animals and plants4–8, but their role in the evolution of senescence is so far not clear2. Most empirical work has been with fruit-flies in laboratory studies, where selection experiments indicate negative genetic correlations between early and late fitness components9–12. But it is not certain how applicable the results of such studies are to natural populations. Here we report that the clutch size of older individuals in the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis is affected by their reproductive effort early in life. This provides empirical support for Williams's idea that costly reproduction accelerates senescence for fertility in a vertebrate species under natural conditions.},

abstract = {Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the evolution of senescence. One of the leading hypotheses, the disposable soma hypothesis, predicts a trade-off, whereby early-life investment in reproduction leads to late-life declines in survival (survival senescence). Testing this hypothesis in natural populations is challenging, but important for understanding the evolution of senescence. We used the long-term data set from a contained, predator-free population of individually marked Seychelles warblers (Acrocephalus sechellensis) to investigate how age-related declines in survival are affected by early-life investment in reproduction and early-life environmental conditions. The disposable soma hypothesis predicts that higher investment in reproduction, or experiencing harsh conditions during early life, will lead to an earlier onset, and an increased rate, of senescence. We found that both sexes showed similar age-related declines in late-life survival consistent with senescence. Individuals that started breeding at a later age showed a delay in survival senescence, but this later onset of breeding did not result in a less rapid decline in late-life survival. Although survival senescence was not directly related to early-life environmental conditions, age of first breeding increased with natal food availability. Therefore, early-life food availability may affect senescence by influencing age of first breeding. The disposable soma hypothesis of senescence is supported by delayed senescence in individuals that started breeding at a later age and therefore invested less in reproduction.},

abstract = {Senescence - the progressive age-dependent decline in performance - occurs in most organisms. There is considerable variation in the onset and rate of senescence between and within species. Yet the causes of this variation are still poorly understood, despite being central to understanding the evolution of senescence. Long-term longitudinal studies on wild animals are extremely well-suited to studying the impact of environmental and individual characteristics (and the interaction between the two) on senescence, and can help us to understand the mechanisms that shape the evolution of senescence. In this review, we summarize and discuss the insights gained from our comprehensive long-term individual-based study of the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis). This species provides an excellent model system in which to investigate the evolution of senescence in the wild. We found that Seychelles warblers show senescent declines in survival and reproduction, and discuss how individual characteristics (body condition, body size) and environmental effects (low- versus high-quality environments) may affect the onset and rate of senescence. Further, we highlight the evidence for trade-offs between early-life investment and senescence. We describe how key cellular and physiological processes (oxidative stress and telomere shortening) underpinning senescence are affected by individual and environmental characteristics in the Seychelles warbler (e.g. food availability, reproductive investment, disease) and we discuss how such physiological variation may mediate the relationship between environmental characteristics and senescence. Based on our work using Seychelles warblers as a model system, we show how insights from long-term studies of wild animals may help unravel the causes of the remarkable variation in senescence observed in natural systems, and highlight areas for promising future research.},

abstract = {Masting, a breeding strategy common in perennial plants, is defined by$\backslash$nseed production that is highly variable over years and synchronized at$\backslash$nthe population level. Resource budget models (RBMs) proposed that$\backslash$nmasting relies on two processes: (i) the depletion of plant reserves$\backslash$nfollowing high fruiting levels, which leads to marked temporal$\backslash$nfluctuations in fruiting; and (ii) outcross pollination that$\backslash$nsynchronizes seed crops among neighboring trees. We revisited the RBM$\backslash$napproach to examine the extent to which masting could be impacted by the$\backslash$ndegree of pollination efficiency, by taking into account various$\backslash$nlogistic relationships between pollination success and pollen$\backslash$navailability. To link masting to other reproductive traits, we split the$\backslash$nreserve depletion coefficient into three biological parameters related$\backslash$nto resource allocation strategies for flowering and fruiting. While$\backslash$noutcross pollination is considered to be the key mechanism that$\backslash$nsynchronizes fruiting in RBMs, our model counterintuitively showed that$\backslash$nintense masting should arise under low-efficiency pollination. When$\backslash$npollination is very efficient, medium-level masting may occur, provided$\backslash$nthat the costs of female flowering (relative to pollen production) and$\backslash$nof fruiting (maximum fruit set and fruit size) are both very high. Our$\backslash$nwork highlights the powerful framework of RBMs, which include explicit$\backslash$nbiological parameters, to link fruiting dynamics to various reproductive$\backslash$ntraits and to provide new insights into the reproductive strategies of$\backslash$nperennial plants.},

Adaptive interpretations of juvenile wastage rely on the argument that the costs of gestation are small compared to those of feeding offspring. Though energetic evidence supports this conclusion, it is unsafe to assume that the relative costs of gestation and lactation to the mother's survival and future reproductive success follow the same pattern because lactation commonly coincides with the period of maximum food availability. Controlling for individual variation, we show that in wild red deer (Cervus elaphus L) any costs of gestation to the mother's subsequent survival and reproductive success are slight compared to those of lactation.},

We therefore re-examine forager sociality by asking a series of nested questions: (1) To what extent are foraging groups random samples from the larger population? (2) What social and economic factors might explain the composition of foraging groups? (3) If certain groups of individuals preferentially forage together, do these same groups also preferentially share with each other when resident at their permanent settlement? (4) To what extent can we understand behavior in the foraging context without consideration of other contexts in which individuals live and work, and vice versa? Among the Ache of Paraguay, we show that foraging treks are not representative of the larger population, individuals vary in the kinds of treks in which they participate, and those who tend to share together at the reservation are more likely to forage together on trek. {\textcopyright} 2004.},

abstract = {The common occurrence of food transfers within human hunter–gatherer and forager–horticultural- ist groups presents exciting test cases for evolutionary models of altruism. While kin biases in sharing are con- sistent with nepotism based on kin selection, there is much debate over the extent to which reciprocal altruism and tolerated scrounging provide useful explanations of observed behavior. This paper presents a model of opti- mal sharing breadth and depth, based on a general non-tit- for-tat form of risk-reduction based reciprocal altruism, and tests a series of predictions using data from Hiwi and Ache foragers. I show that large, high variance food items are shared more widely than small, easily acquired food items. Giving is conditional upon receiving in pairwise interactions and this correlation is usually stronger when the exchange of value rather than quantities is considered. Larger families and low producing families receive more and give less, consistent with the notion that marginal value may be a more salient currency than quantity.},

abstract = {The variance effective population size for age structured populations is generally hard to estimate and the temporal method often gives biased estimates. Here, we give an explicit expression for a correction factor which, combined with estimates from the temporal method, yield approximately unbiased estimates. The calculation of the correction factor requires knowledge of the age specific offspring distribution and survival probabilities as well as possible correlation between survival and reproductive success. In order to relax these requirements, we show that only first order moments of these distributions need to be known if the time between samples is large, or individuals from all age classes which reproduce are sampled. A very explicit approximate expression for the asymptotic coefficient of standard deviation of the estimator is derived, and it can be used to construct confidence intervals and optimal ways of weighting information from different markers. The asymptotic coefficient of standard deviation can also be used to design studies and we show that in order to maximize the precision for a given sample size, individuals from older age classes should be sampled since their expected variance of allele frequency change is higher and easier to estimate. However, for populations with fluctuating age class sizes, the accuracy of the method is reduced when samples are taken from older age classes with high demographic variation. We also present a method for simultaneous estimation of the variance effective and census population size.},

abstract = {1. A wild Edinburgh strain of D. melanogaster produced no flies showing a break in the posterior crossvein when bred at 25⚬ C., but a certain number occurred (as phenocopies) when the pupae aged 21-23 hours were subjected to 40⚬ C. for four hours. 2. Selection was practised for and against the appearance of the phenocopy, and rapid progress occurred in both directions. After about 14 generations of selection, some flies in the upward selected strain were found to show the effect even when not exposed to the heat shock. From these, lines were built up which threw a high proportion of crossveinless individuals when kept continuously at 25⚬ C. (and even more at 18⚬ C.). 3. The crossveinless character, originally a typical 'acquired character,' has become incorporated into the genetic make up of the selected races. A process of 'genetic assimilation' is described by which this might be supposed to happen; it depends on the tendency of selection not merely to increase the frequency of any favorable character, but also to stabilise its development. A similar suggestion has been advanced by Schmalhausen (1947). 4. The genetic basis of the assimilated crossveinless character is polygenic. There is little evidence of any definite distinction between canalising and switch genes.},

Meanwhile, species are faced with non-stationary environmental conditions (changing mean, variance, or both) created by climate and landscape change. To close the gap between contemporary reality and demographic theory, we develop a set of transient life table response experiments (LTREs) for decomposing realised population growth rates into contributions from specific vital rates and components of population structure. Using transient LTREs in a theoretical framework, we reveal that established concepts in population biology will require revision because of reliance on approaches that do not address the influence of unstable population structure on population growth and mean fitness. Going forward, transient LTREs will enhance understanding of demography and improve the explanatory power of models used to understand ecological and evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {Variation among individuals in robustness has been posed as a general explanation for the lack of increase in late-life mortality rates. Here, we test corollaries of this heterogeneity theory. One is that populations that have undergone strong laboratory selection for differentiated stress resistance should show significant differences in their late-life mortality schedules. To test this corollary, we employed 40 410 flies from three groups of Drosophila melanogaster populations that differ substantially in their resistance to starvation. No significant differences between these groups were found for late-life mortality. Another corollary of the heterogeneity theory is that there should be late-life plateaus in stress resistance that coincide with the plateau stage of the mortality curve. In 20 994 flies from six replicate outbred laboratory populations, we measured mortality rates every other day and starvation and desiccation resistance every 7 days. Both male and female starvation and desiccation resistance clearly decreased with time overall. There was no late-life plateau in male desiccation resistance. A late-life plateau in male starvation resistance may exist, however. Together, these two experiments generally constitute evidence against heterogeneity as a major contributor to the phenomenon of late-life mortality plateaus.

abstract = {1. Energetics of reproduction in birds is reviewed with the question in mind how the parent adjusts its effort in relation to prevailing environmental conditions in order to maximize the output of young in its lifetime. Emphasis is on proximate controls, rather than ultimate factors measurable in terms of adult survival and recruitment of young. 2. The decision to breed or not to breed is clearly related to body condition of the female, presumably because of the implications this has for survival. 3. Laying date and clutch size are likewise under the influence of female condition and can hence be modified by experiments involving supplementary feeding. Natural variation in these features may often be related to territory quality. 4. How the bird decides whether or not to commence a second brood is not clear, but in the Great Tit the habitat-related difference in incidence of second broods is functionally understandable when survival probabilities of birds at different times are considered. 5. A distinction is made between a "capital" and "income" model for translatting rates of change of female body condition into appropriate decisions on laying date and clutch size and experiments are suggested that discriminate between the two. 6. Lack's view that brood size is in an evolutionary sense adjusted in order to balance food requirement and foraging capacity of the parents is accepted, and growth rates in nidicolous birds are analysed to ascertain if a finer adjustment exists superimposed on the integer steps of brood adjustment. Critical for this analysis are groups of birds where broods of one are common, since only in these circumstances is growth adjustment the only strategy open to the parents. In common with other animals, growth rate is related to mature body size but within a category of adult weight clear examples can be found for retardation of growth rate in pelecaniform and charadriiform species with singleton broods. 7. Since daily energy requirement is related to nestling size and growth rate, retardation of growth is explicable as a strategy only in terms of reducing the daily commitment of the parents, not reducing the total cost of producing a nestling. 8. An additional economy in growth is to reduce the contribution of fat to the nestling body. 9. Implied in Lack's view of brood size is a limitation of parental foraging capacity, and the last section of the paper is devoted to exploration of the proximate factors delimiting what Royama terms the optimal working capacity of parents feeding young. Observations of parent starlings confronted with manipulated brood size suggest a limit on the time that can be devoted to energetically extravagant flight activity, rather than a shortage of absolute time. Beyond the limit to which stressed parents can be made to fly, body weight declines. 10. Preliminary data on energy metabolized daily by parents confronted with large broods conforms to the simplified view that parental effort on a sustained basis equates to energy mobilization equivalent to 4 B.M.R. units and it is suggested that this level of energy expenditure represents a proximal decision substrate for determining the optimal working capacity of the parent. 11. The paper ends with a plea for more research on the proximate controls of avian reproduction, and calls attention to the central importance of the protein bank to parental body condition.},

abstract = {Classical age-structured mass-action models such as the McKendrick-von Foerster equation have been extensively studied but they are structurally unable to describe stochastic fluctuations or population-size-dependent birth and death rates. Stochastic theories that treat semi-Markov age-dependent processes using e.g., the Bellman-Harris equation, do not resolve a population's age-structure and are unable to quantify population-size dependencies. Conversely, current theories that include size-dependent population dynamics (e.g., mathematical models that include carrying capacity such as the Logistic equation) cannot be easily extended to take into account age-dependent birth and death rates. In this paper, we present a systematic derivation of a new fully stochastic kinetic theory for interacting age-structured populations. By defining multiparticle probability density functions, we derive a hierarchy of kinetic equations for the stochastic evolution of an ageing population undergoing birth and death. We show that the fully stochastic age-dependent birth-death process precludes factorization of the corresponding probability densities, which then must be solved by using a BBGKY-like hierarchy. However, explicit solutions are derived in two simple limits and compared with their corresponding mean-field results. Our results generalize both deterministic models and existing master equation approaches by providing an intuitive and efficient way to simultaneously model age- and population-dependent stochastic dynamics applicable to the study of demography, stem cell dynamics, and disease evolution.},

abstract = {One way of modeling the evolution in time of an age-structured population is to set up the evolution process as a partial differential equation in which time and age are the independent variables. The resulting equation, known as the McKendrick equation, has received attention recently from mathematicians. Some advantages of the PDE are that it can easily be adapted to include more detail in the model, including explicit time-dependence in the coefficients and even some nonlinear effects. The initial-boundary conditions for the McKendrick equation, imposed by the population model, are not the standard side conditions one sees in PDE theory for an evolution equation. In the simplest case, the problem reduces to a well-known model in demography, the Lotka integral equation. In this paper, we explain the solution of the McKendrick model and compare the McKendrick equation with other common models for age-structured populations (the Leslie matrix and the difference equation, as well as the integral equation) in several ways. The approaches differ in their suitability for computation, their ease of generalization, and their adaptability to different demographic objectives and other biological applications. With small intervals of age and time all forms are identical, but if the intervals are finite, differences will appear in the numerical results. The structure of solutions of the partial differential equation contributes to better understanding and computation of population models.},

abstract = {There is significant recent interest in Peto's paradox and the related problem of the evolution of large, long-lived organisms in terms of cancer robustness. Peto's paradox refers to the expectation that large, long-lived organisms have a higher lifetime cancer risk, which is not the case: a paradox. This paradox, however, is circular: large, long-lived organisms are large and long-lived because they are cancer robust. Lifetime risk, meanwhile, depends on the age distributions of both cancer and competing risks: if cancer strikes before competing risks, then lifetime risk is high; if not, not. Because no set of competing risks is generally prevalent, it is instructive to temporarily dispose of competing risks and investigate the pure age dynamics of cancer under the multistage model of carcinogenesis. In addition to augmenting earlier results, I show that in terms of cancer-free lifespan large organisms reap greater benefits from an increase in cellular cancer robustness than smaller organisms. Conversely, a higher cellular cancer robustness renders cancer-free lifespan more resilient to an increase in size. This interaction may be an important driver of the evolution of large, cancer-robust organisms.},

abstract = {Theory predicts that senescence should inevitably evolve because selection pressure declines with age. Yet, data show that senescence is not a universal phenomenon. How can these observations peacefully coexist? Evolution of any trait hinges on its impact on fitness. A complete mathematical description of change in fitness, the total fitness differential, involves selection pressure along with a perturbation function that describes how the vital rates, mortality and fecundity, are affected across ages. We propose that the perturbation function can be used to model trade-offs when vital rates are perturbed in different directions and magnitude at different ages. We find that for every trade-off we can identify parameter values for which senescence does evolve and others for which it does not. We argue that this reconciles the apparent contradiction between data and theory. The total fitness differential is also instrumental in deriving mathematical relationships between alternative indicators of selection pressure. We show examples and highlight that any indicator combined with the right perturbation function can be used to parameterize a specific biological change. Biological considerations should motivate what perturbation functions are used. We interpret the relevance of Hamilton's finding that selection pressure declines for the evolution of senescence: declining selection pressure is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {The differences in demographic and life-history processes between organisms living in the same population have important consequences for ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Modern statistical and computational methods allow the investigation of individual and shared (among homogeneous groups) determinants of the observed variation in growth. We use an Empirical Bayes approach to estimate individual and shared variation in somatic growth using a von Bertalanffy growth model with random effects. To illustrate the power and generality of the method, we consider two populations of marble trout Salmo marmoratus living in Slovenian streams, where individually tagged fish have been sampled for more than 15 years. We use year-of-birth cohort, population density during the first year of life, and individual random effects as potential predictors of the von Bertalanffy growth function's parameters k (rate of growth) and L∞ (asymptotic size). Our results showed that size ranks were largely maintained throughout marble trout lifetime in both populations. According to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the best models showed different growth patterns for year-of-birth cohorts as well as the existence of substantial individual variation in growth trajectories after accounting for the cohort effect. For both populations, models including density during the first year of life showed that growth tended to decrease with increasing population density early in life. Model validation showed that predictions of individual growth trajectories using the random-effects model were more accurate than predictions based on mean size-at-age of fish.},

@book{Crow1970,
abstract = {Many of the ideas current in discussions of problems of evolution and of natural and artificial selection stem from Sewall Wright. Until recently, with the appearance of the first two volumes of Wright's own trilogy see A.B.A., 37, No. 2116 and 39, No. 1331, anyone working with these topics in detail needed to go to the original papers. The gap is further narrowed by this book by two well-known authors. It is aimed primarily at graduate students and the greater part does not require a background of advanced mathematics. The final two chapters, in which gene frequency distributions are introduced, are at a much higher level, and students may find them very heavy weather indeed. Nor are they properly integrated with the rest of the book. For instance, on page 383 the authors discuss, from the stand-point of differential equations, the problem of random drift, and derive expressions very similar to those found by quite different methods on page 337. But no cross reference is made. Nor indeed is the reader given any clue as to why a partial differential equation should possess eigen values and eigen vectors. This could well have been done by the inclusion of a section in which the gene frequency distribution for a population of size 2N is treated as discrete in being able to take 2N+ 1 possible values. Change from generation to generation is then specified by the transition probability matrix. After all, Feller dealt with drift without selection by this method in 1951, and many other workers have used it since. In the past term, I have, with some colleagues, taken a group of graduate students through the book. In doing so, I became aware that in several places the ends were not as neatly tied as I had hoped-very often because the initial assumptions of the treatment were not clearly stated. This is perhaps inevitable when topics are dealt with didactically for the first time, and occurs in discussions of the sub-division of populations, of assortative mating and of effective population size in bisexual populations. I have perhaps tended to take for granted that, by two such authors, the book was bound to be excellent, and have concentrated rather on its deficiencies. May I then say firmly that my original assumption was justified? It is about fifty years since Fisher, Haldane and Wright first began to develop a theory of natural and artificial selection. In view of this, it is perhaps surprising that, arising from evidence from completely new sources such as starch-gel electrophoresis or the sequence of amino acids in peptide chains of various species, arguments should still be so animated about such fundamental problems as the possibility that many of the substitutions which have taken place in evolution may have been non-selective, or as to the reason why so much genetic variation seems to be maintained within random-breeding populations. I suggest that this is because previous theory, at least in its more precise forms, has been too analytical has concentrated too much on the evolution of the parts while forgetting that an organism functions as a whole. Se we have at the moment only the rudiments of a theory of the evolution of the genotype as a unit, or of the phenotype as a unit, bearing in mind now that any particular measurement may be affected by a great many genes. And any satisfactory theory would of course have to deal with the environment as a whole. Perhaps a tall order! Alan Robertson.},

abstract = {Antagonistic selection—where alleles at a locus have opposing effects on male and female fitness (“sexual antagonism”) or between components of fitness (“antagonistic pleiotropy”)—might play an important role in maintaining population genetic variation and in driving phylogenetic and genomic patterns of sexual dimorphism and life-history evolution. While prior theory has thoroughly characterized the conditions necessary for antagonistic balancing selection to operate, we currently know little about the evolutionary interactions between antagonistic selection, recurrent mutation, and genetic drift, which should collectively shape empirical patterns of genetic variation. To fill this void, we developed and analyzed a series of population genetic models that simultaneously incorporate these processes. Our models identify two general properties of antagonistically selected loci. First, antagonistic selection inflates heterozygosity and fitness variance across a broad parameter range—a result that applies to alleles maintained by balancing selection and by recurrent mutation. Second, effective population size and genetic drift profoundly affect the statistical frequency distributions of antagonistically selected alleles. The “efficacy” of antagonistic selection (i.e., its tendency to dominate over genetic drift) is extremely weak relative to classical models, such as directional selection and overdominance. Alleles meeting traditional criteria for strong selection (Nes {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1, where Ne is the effective population size, and s is a selection coefficient for a given sex or fitness component) may nevertheless evolve as if neutral. The effects of mutation and demography may generate population differences in overall levels of antagonistic fitness variation, as well as molecular population genetic signatures of balancing selection.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a growth in numerical studies using the comparative method. The method usually involves a comparison of two phenotypes across a range of species or higher taxa, or a comparison of one phenotype with an environmental variable. Objectives of such studies vary, and include assessing whether one variable is correlated with another and assessing whether the regres-sion of one variable on another differs significantly from some expected value. Notable recent studies using statistical methods of this type include Pilbeam and Gould's (1974) regressions of tooth area on several size measurements in mam-mals; Sherman's (1979) test of the relation between insect chromosome numbers and social behavior; Damuth's (1981) investigation of population density and body size in mammals; Martin's (1981) regression of brain weight in mammals on body weight; Givnish's (1982) examination of traits associated with dioecy across the families of angiosperms; and Armstrong's (1983) regressions of brain weight on body weight and basal metabolism rate in mammals. My intention is to point out a serious statistical problem with this approach, a problem that affects all of these studies. It arises from the fact that species are part of a hierarchically structured phylogeny, and thus cannot be regarded for statisti-cal purposes as if drawn independently from the same distribution. This problem has been noticed before, and previous suggestions of ways of coping with it are briefly discussed. The nonindependence can be circumvented in principle if ade-quate information on the phylogeny is available. The information needed to do so and the limitations on its use will be discussed. The problem will be discussed and illustrated with reference to continuous variables, but the same statistical issues arise when one or both of the variables are discrete, in which case the statistical methods involve contingency tables rather than regressions and correlations. THE PROBLEM Suppose that we have examined eight species and wish to know whether their brain size (Y) is proportional to their body size (X). We may wish to test whether the slope of the regression of Y on X (or preferably of log Y on log X) is unity. Figure 1 shows a scatter diagram of hypothetical data. It is tempting to simply do},

abstract = {The inclusion of flexible behavior in population models can be viewed as part of the development of a mechanistic population/community framework based on individual-level concepts. Based on short-term experiments and analyses of the dynamics of nonstructured models, trait-mediated indirect effects resulting from flexible behavior have been suggested to have major effects on population and community dynamics. We use physiologically structured population models (PSPMs) to account for and assess the importance of flexible behavior in population models where individuals differ substantially in size. We investigate a consumer-resource system in which a size-structured consumer feeds on two resources that are present in two habitats differing in predation risk (pelagic open water vs. littoral vegetation). We compare two flexible rules that individuals might use to trade off foraging gains and size-dependent mortality risks in the two habitats. One rule maximizes the ratio of growth over mortality, and the other optimizes the expected instantaneous biomass increase.As a result of strong population feedback, the dynamics and habitat use are qualitatively the same for both rules when open-water mortalities are low, and indeed differ little from a case in which individuals use the two habitats in a fixed proportion. At higher open-water mortalities, the consumers using the two flexible rules show high-amplitude population cycles, whereas consumers using a fixed rule cannot persist. Overall, our results suggest that the behavioral rule used by individuals may be of minor importance, whereas the population feedback is of major importance. In nonstructured models, increased persistence induced by flexible behavior co-occurs with destabilization, as we find here, but the mechanisms behind this pattern are different, driven by cohort cycles rather than by the paradox of enrichment. We argue that extrapolating from experimental data which describe short-term experiments may overemphasize or misrepresent the long-term, population-level effects of flexible behavior. The inclusion of behavior as a proper individual state in physiologically structured population models remains a fundamental issue to solve.},

abstract = {4 elements of studying life histories: 1) Demography: connects variation in age and size specific variation in fecundity and mortality to variation in fitness: compares the strength of natural selection on different traits. 2) Quantitative genetics and reaction norms: statistical model of effects of many genes acting at once. 3) Trade-offs: physiology contributes insights into the mechanisms that cause trade-offs. 4) Lineage-specific effects Demography Interpretations of equations and symbols in demography differ for classical demography and life history theory. IN CD they represent whole organisms in the popn and their age-specific birth and death schedules. Same equations and symbols in LHT refer to effects of gene substitution. A population with a constant birth and death schedule will attain a stable age distribution and then grow exponentially at a constant rate. The rate at which it grows can be calculated from the Euler-Lotka equation. Assumes stable age distribution and constant mortality and fertility rates. Popn in stable age distribution may be increasing, decreasing or unchanging but the proportion of organisms in each age class is stable. Generation time is the average age of mothers of in a popn with stable age dist. Williams (1957, 1966) divided reproductive value of female into 2 components: births in current age class and reproductive value in next age class (residual reproductive value). But RRV is not just reproductive value of female in next age class - need to add 2 components: probability of surviving to next age class given female has survived to current age class, and discount term necessary becasue popn maybe growing. Therefore cost of reprouction takes 2 main forms: increase in present reproduction may have negative influence on surviving to next age class, or on reproductive value of next age class, or both. One central idea in LHT is that current and residual reproductive value should be so balanced that in every age class fitness is maximal. Calculating this balance for all age classes predicts the distribution of reproductive effort across the entire lifetime. Quantitative genetics and reaction norms Whereas demography analyses the phenotypic sources of variation in fitness that produce natural selection, quantitative genetics and reaction norms are used to analyse the genetic variation that conditions the response to selection. The heritabilities of fitness components are lower than heritabilities of other traits but considerable genetic variation for LH traits is maintained in nature. Sometimes heritabilities of LH traits are large. Five explanations for this: mutation-selection balance, genotype by environment interactions in heterogeneous environments, negative genetic covariance, gene flow and flat fitness profiles. Quantitative genetics deals with continuously varying traits - quantitative, metric or polygenic traits. Traits that clearly separate into distinct classes are called Mendelian. Reaction norm is the set of phenotypes produced by a single genotype across a range of environmental conditions. Additive genetic variation is the variation in the breeding values of individuals in the popn. Breeding value is twice the deviation of an individual's progeny from the popn mean when it is mated at random with a sample of the popn. Non-additive effects include dominance, interactions with other loci (epistasis) and maternal effects in some experimental designs. Trade-offs Distinguish between physiological trade-offs - energy allocation between 2 or more functions competing for the same resources within a single individual and evolutionary trade-offs - defined by manipulation expts on phenotypes and by correlated response to selection on popns. Best studied TOs are between current reproduction and survival, current and future reproduction, reproduction and growth, reproduction and condition and number and quality of offspring. 2 methods for measuring TOs: 1) select on one trait and measure correlated responses on the other - artifical selection expts 2) manipulate phenotype and study consequences in same individuals - eg, expts on clutch and egg size Red deer: adult mortality higher in females nursing offspring. Age dependent - only significant in females over 10 yrs. Principle of allocation may be affected by: 1) if resource other than energy is limiting eg time or mineral nutrient, energy allocations do not TO 2) if energy is limiting but functions differ in their sensitivity to variation in the amount of energy allocated, then though TOs are always there, will be insignificantly small under some circs and large under others 3) if certain amounts of energy are always allocated to given activities, then allocations are made with what is left over},

abstract = {This book is concerned with the diversity of life histories and in particular with the ways in which variation can be analyzed and predicted. It is both an exposition of ways in which to view the world and an account of what we have learned about the evolution of life histories. Chapter 1 examines two different approaches to analysis, the genetic approach and the optimization approach. Though genetic aspects are discussed throughout the book the principal method of analysis is optimization. The second half of chapter 1 discusses the broad scope of constraints within which life histories can vary. Though much can be achieved without explicit recourse to genetic argument, a proper understanding of the evolution of life histories necessitates an appreciation of the implicit genetic assumptions. These are discussed in chapter 2. Chapter 3 presents the general framework of life history theory, primarily the concept of fitness and trade-offs. The mathematical tools by which predictions can be made and tested are described in chapter 4. Factors affecting the age schedule of birth and death are described in chapter 5 and costs of reproduction in chapter 6. Chapters 7 through 10 each cover a particular aspect of the life history: age and size at maturity, reproductive effort, clutch size, offspring size.},

The disposable soma theory of aging permeates the book and rightly so; this theory states that selection only maintains those aspects of bodily function required for reproduction ...

abstract = {Restriction of food intake extends lifespan in evolutionarily diverse organisms, including mammals. Dietary restriction (DR) also delays the appearance of ageing-related damage and pathology and keeps organisms in a youthful state for longer. DR has hence been suggested to lower the rate of ageing. Analysis of mortality rates can be used to test this idea. During ageing, mortality rates in general increase, approximately exponentially. Lifespan can be extended either by a reduction in the rate of increase in mortality rate with age or a lowering of the initial rate of mortality. A reduction in the slope of a mortality trajectory has generally been taken to indicate that the rate of ageing has been lowered. Data on the effects of temperature on mortality in Drosophila are in accordance with this idea. Lowered temperature extends lifespan solely by lowering the slope of the mortality trajectory and flies with a hotter thermal history have permanently elevated death rates. In contrast, lowering of the initial rate of mortality has been taken to leave the rate of ageing unaffected. In Drosophila and in mice, but not in rats, DR extends lifespan by lowering the initial mortality rate. In Drosophila, the effect of DR is acute, and mortality rate switches rapidly between DR and control values with the corresponding changes in nutritional regime. DR in Drosophila therefore has no impact upon the rate of ageing. Possible mechanisms by which DR can both delay damage and pathology and yet act acutely to determine mortality rates are discussed. In rodents, some phenotypes associated with DR, including microarray profiles, show rapid switching with changed nutritional regime, pointing to potentially acute effects of DR in mammals. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

@article{Bell1977,
abstract = {The life history of the exploited lake whitefish (c. clupeaformis) population of Lesser Slave Lake, Alberta, is described. Mean age is high, having increased under continued exploitation during the last 30 yr. A method of estimating the population age structure is described. The apparent annual rate of survival of adult fish has fluctuated markedly, but on average seems to lie in the interval 0.40-0.50; the annual rate of natural survival is estimated to be 0.53. Juveniles survive better than adults. Rate of survival during the 1st yr of life was estimated to be {\{}approx{\}} 0.0002. Maturity was late, the median age at first reproduction being 6-6.5 yr. The regressions of fecundity on age and length are described; length now contributed almost all the attributable variance to maturity and fecundity. The sex ratio fluctuates in time; this is caused by the fluctuations in age structure, since sex ratio varies with age. The relationship between sex ratio and age is used to calculate the relative rates of survival of male and female fish. These data are used to construct a life table and to compute population parameters. It is inferred that the ability of the population to respond to exploitation has been eroded during the last 30 yr. After {\{}approx{\}} 30 yr of large- amplitude oscillation the whitefish population collapsed in 1965. This does not seem to have been caused by chronic overfishing. In the 1st place, the rate of fishing mortality is no more than moderate. Secondly, a multiple regression equation describing whitefish catches in 48 other Alberta lakes in which there has been no overall decline in catch successfully predicts the observed mean catch at Lesser Slave Lake. The oscillations in catch are claimed to reflect a limit cycle in the abundance of the whitefish, driven by a lagged relationship between a predator (the fishermen) and its prey (the whitefish). Whether or not this cycle was deterministically stable, such behavior will inevitable put the population in risk or extinction during troughs in the cycle. The authors suggest that current management policies may encourage the destabilization of whitefish populations, and a remedy is proposed.},

abstract = {After metamorphosis, smooth or common newts (Triturus vulgaris vulgaris [Linn]) disperse on land, where they live as juveniles before returning to the water as breeding adults. The population age-structure was obtained by dissecting the standard length frequency distribution, a procedure which is justified in the text. Juveniles have an uncomplicated age-structure, the number of individuals in successively later age-classes being reduced by mortality and by recruitment to the adult population. Among adult newts, the most frequent age-class is nearly central, indicating the existence of extensive variation in the age at maturity. Growth continues throughout life, the rate of growth decreasing with age. The annual survival rate of adult newts as estimated by a census method, and from the age-structure, was found to be {\~{}} 50{\%}, being rather greater in ♀ ♀ than in ♂ ♂. Less reliable data indicate the annual survival rate of juveniles was {\~{}} 80{\%}. Maturity is attained between the ages of 3 and 7 yr, most individuals reproducing for the first time at 6 or 7 yr of age. The number of eggs laid increases with age from {\~{}} 100 at age 3 to {\~{}} 400 at age 12; there is also an effect of ♀ age on oocyte size, which may influence subsequent larval survival. Smooth newts breed annually. Reproduction diverts surplus energy from somatic growth, and thereby decreases potential future fecundity in animals whose fecundity is proportional to body size. Individuals maturing at different ages, therefore, have different schedules of fecundity, which were estimated through the use of microbomb calorimetry. Population size was found to be lognormally distributed, with a mean of {\~{}} 70. The sex ratio of juvenile newts was near equality, but a majority of ♀ ♀ comprised most adult populations. This imbalance is due to greater mortality of adult ♂ ♂, which results in an age-specific trend in the sex ratio. There are 2 breeding migrations: 1 in autumn and 1 in spring. It is likely that newts migrate during autumn when about to reproduce for the first time, and thereafter migrate during spring. Terrestrial newts appear to move little; there is some evidence that colonization of newly dug ponds is achieved by the infrequent emigration of juveniles. During its life, a smooth newt occupies a succession of ecological niches. Moreover, different individuals may occupy different niches, or may occupy the same niches for different periods of time. It is speculated that in large newt populations the complex life history is able to trap genetic variation and to dampen fluctuations in population size. However, it is suggested that these group attributes have arisen largely as the result of selection between individuals. Breeding only once (rather than repeatedly) will reduce fitness because the additional fecundity necessary to balance the loss of later reproduction cannot be attained. Early maturity appears to be favored in ♂ ♂ and late maturity in ♀ ♀ ; these opposed selection pressures may contribute to the observed age variation at maturity. Finally, the sex ratio does not vary with population density, and is therefore thought to be controlled by natural selection.},

abstract = {1. We assessed the relative influence of variability in recruitment age, dynamic reproductive investment (time-specific reproductive states) and frailty (unobserved differences in survival abilities across individuals) on survival in the black-legged kittiwake. Furthermore, we examined whether observed variability in survival trajectories was best explained by immediate reproductive investment, cumulative investment, or both. 2. Individuals that delayed recruitment (≥ age 7) suffered a higher mortality risk than early recruits (age 3), especially later in life, suggesting that recruitment age may be an indicator of individual quality. Although recruitment age helped explain variation in survival, time-varying reproductive investment had a more substantial influence. 3. The dichotomy of attempting to breed or not explained variability in survival across life better than other parameterizations of reproductive states such as clutch size, brood size or breeding success. In the kittiwake, the sinequanon condition to initiate reproduction is to hold a nest site, which is considered a very competitive activity. This might explain why attempting to breed is the key level of investment that affects survival, independent of the outcome (failure or success). 4. Interestingly, the more individuals cumulate reproductive attempts over life, the lower their mortality risk, indicating that breeding experience may be a good indicator of parental quality as well. In contrast, attempting to breed at time t increased the risk of mortality between t and t + 1. We thus detected an immediate trade-off between attempting to breed and survival in this population; however, the earlier individuals recruited, and the more breeding experience they accumulated, the smaller the cost. 5. Lastly, unobserved heterogeneity across individuals improved model fit more (1{\textperiodcentered}3 times) than fixed and dynamic sources of observed heterogeneity in reproductive investment, demonstrating that it is critical to account for both sources of individual heterogeneity when studying survival trajectories. Only after simultaneously accounting for both sources of heterogeneity were we able to detect the 'cost' of immediate reproductive investment on survival and the 'benefit' of cumulative breeding attempts (experience), a proxy to individual quality.},

abstract = {To identify the responses of a predator to resource variation, age-specific fecundity and survivorship were measured at several food levels for the sessile, predatory ciliate protozoan Tokophrya lemnarum Stain. The major life history characteristics identified were: a direct relationship between net reproductive rate and food level; age-specific fecundity closely following food intake rate; a nutrient supply endowment for each embryo at birth; and an inverse relationship between net reproductive rate-food level and life span. Totally starved individuals had the longest mean life spans. Increased survival time at low food levels probably results from low metabolic rate between meals and a slowed accumulation of toxic waste products. Fecundity is directly related to prey number and prey size. It is postulated that this set of adaptations acts to decrease variability of population size in a predator which cannot control its hunting rate and in which prey density must vary greatly during the lifetime of an individual.},

abstract = {Evaluating the distribution of species richness where biodiversity is high but has been insufficiently sampled is not an easy task. Species distribution modelling has become a useful approach for predicting their ranges, based on the relationships between species records and environmental variables. Overlapping predictions of individual distributions could be a useful strategy for obtaining estimates of species richness and composition in a region, but these estimates should be evaluated using a proper validation process, which compares the predicted richness values and composition with accurate data from independent sources. In this study, we propose a simple approach to estimate model performance for several distributional predictions generated simultaneously. This approach is particularly suitable when species distribution modelling techniques that require only presence data are used. The individual distributions for the 370 known amphibian species of Mexico were predicted using maxent to model data on their known presence (66 113 presence-only records). Distributions were subsequently overlapped to obtain a prediction of species richness. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the overall species richness values predicted for the region with observed and predicted values from 118 well-surveyed sites, each with an area of c. 100 km(2), which were identified using species accumulation curves and nonparametric estimators. The derived models revealed a remarkable heterogeneity of species richness across the country, provided information about species composition per site and allowed us to obtain a measure of the spatial distribution of prediction errors. Examining the magnitude and location of model inaccuracies, as well as separately assessing errors of both commission and omission, highlights the inaccuracy of the predictions of species distribution models and the need to provide measures of uncertainty along with the model results. The combination of a species distribution modelling method like maxent and species richness estimators offers a useful tool for identifying when the overall pattern provided by all model predictions might be representing the geographical patterns of species richness and composition, regardless of the particular quality or accuracy of the predictions for each individual species.},

Brood reductions caused an increased food intake by the nestlings, in spite of (non-significantly) reduced parental hunting activity. Local survival of the parents was negatively correlated with the experimental change in brood size. (3) A review of the literature on brood enlargements is presented, showing that parents were able to raise more young till fledging than their natural broods in twenty-nine out of forty altricial bird species investigated. Negative effects of brood enlargements on parental survival or future reproduction were established in eight out of twelve species investigated. (4) The results are consistent with the theory that parental work for the offspring entails an inherent reduction in future reproductive output and that natural broods, by being smaller than the maximum number of nestlings that can be raised, maximize the total reproductive output.},

abstract = {The fitness costs of reproduction can be masked by individual differences, and may only become apparent during adverse environmental conditions. Individual differences, however, are usually assessed by reproductive success, so how fitness costs are influenced by the interplay between the environmental context and overall individual differences requires 23 further investigation. Here, we evaluated fitness costs of reproduction based on 15 years of monitoring of individual Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) during a period when the population was affected by a severe disease outbreak (pneumonia). We quantified fitness costs using a novel multi-event capture-mark-recapture (CMR) modeling approach that accounted for uncertainty in reproductive status to estimate the survival and reproductive success of female ibex while also accounting for overall individual heterogeneity using mixture models. Our results show that the ability of females to reproduce was highly heterogeneous. In particular, one group including 76{\%} of females had a much higher probability of giving birth annually (between 0.66 and 0.77 depending on the previous reproductive status) than females of the second group (24{\%} of females, between 0 and 0.05 probability of giving birth annually). Low reproductive costs in terms of future reproduction occurred and were independent of the pneumonia outbreak. There was no survival cost of reproduction either before or after the epizootic, but the cost was high during the epizootic. Our findings indicate that adverse environmental conditions, such as disease outbreaks, may lead to survival costs of reproduction in long-lived species and select against females that have a high reproductive effort. Thereby, the occurrence of adverse conditions increases the diversity of reproductive tactics within a population.},

abstract = {If a predator crops prey of certain ages in preference to others, it may be acting as an agent of selection, causing genetic change in the prey population. This paper adapts a model of life-history evolution to investigate some selective consequences of several patterns of age-specific predation. The model allows allocation of resources to reproduction, growth, and maintenance in an age class i to be varied. Subject to several assumptions, it is shown that increasing predation on individuals younger than i leads to selection for lower rates of reproduction at age i. Conversely, increasing predation on individuals older than and/or equal to i leads to selection for greater rates of reproduction. If individuals from both these age ranges are cropped the optimal rate of reproduction may either increase or decrease. The only circumstance under which no change occurs arises if all individuals irrespective of age are liable to be cropped, or if the effects of predation on younger and older age classes exactly cancel one another. The implications of these results to the management of populations exploited by man are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most human demographic data, particularly those on natural fertility populations, find no relationship or even a positive association between fertility and longevity. The present study aims to ascertain whether there is a trade-off between fertility and longevity in the mouse model. METHODS: The study was focused on the first litter produced by 10- to 14-wk-old hybrid (C57BL/6JIco female X CBA/JIco male) mice. A single female/male per litter was individually housed with a male/female at the age of 25 and 52 wk, respectively, until the end of reproductive life in females or natural death in males under controlled housing conditions. Post-reproductive females and virgin mice were reared until natural death. Cox regression models with forward stepwise variable selection were fitted to examine the effect of several fertility variables on expectation of survival times. RESULTS: Virgin females displayed higher life expectancy than virgin males. The relative risk of dying for a virgin male at a particular age was 2.116 [99{\%} confidence interval: 1.317, 3.398] times that of a virgin female. No significant differences on expectation of survival times between virgin and mated females, and between virgin and mated males were found. Furthermore, total number of pups at weaning and total number of litters produced by a dam/stud, time interval between mating and last litter, time interval between litters, and age at last litter were not significant predictors of expectation of survival times in both mated females and mated males. CONCLUSIONS: Like in most human studies, the present study evidences no relationship between total number of offspring/litters produced by a dam/stud and expectation of survival times. Moreover, the present data are in agreement with the general phenomenon of a bias in life expectancy in favor of females.},

abstract = {To better understand the potential trade-off between female reproductive investment and longevity in an emerging model of human healthspan, we studied pet dogs to determine whether intensity of reproduction (total number of offspring) encumbered the likelihood of exceptional longevity. This hypothesis was tested by collecting and analyzing lifetime medical histories, including complete reproductive histories, for a cohort of canine "centenarians"--exceptionally long-lived Rottweiler dogs that lived more than 30{\%} longer than the breed's average life expectancy. Reproductive intensity (number of litters, total number of pups) and tempo of reproductive effort (age at first reproduction, mean interbirth interval, age at last reproduction) in 78 exceptionally long-lived female Rottweilers ({\textgreater}13 years old) were compared to a cohort of 97 female Rottweilers that had usual longevity (age at death 8.0-10.75 years). We found no evidence that a mother's physiological investment in offspring was associated with disadvantaged longevity. Instead, similar to some studies in women, our data showed an inverted U-shaped trend, suggesting that moderate investment in reproduction may promote longevity. Late reproductive success, a much-studied surrogate of maternal fitness in women, was not a strong predictor of longevity in this canine cohort. Instead, independent of reproductive investment, the duration of lifetime ovary exposure was significantly associated with highly successful aging. Our results from exceptionally long-lived pet dogs provide rationale for further investigative efforts to understand the ovary-sensitive biological factors that promote healthy longevity in women and pet dogs.},

The age cut-offs in each analysis were set to include 50{\%}, 75{\%} and 90{\%} of the offspring produced in each of the population samples. Only one of 68 regressions was significant, and its slope was positive. In addition, we examined the relationship between age at first reproduction up to a certain age and longevity after that age, generally 5 years (3-8), among 17 species of mammal and 12 species of bird. Only one of these regressions had a significantly positive slope, indicating that early reproduction rarely reduces lifespan. Overall, we found no evidence that producing offspring in a zoo environment influences the age at death. Thus, although trade-offs might apply in natural populations under resource limitation, neither pregnancy, growth of the foetus and lactation in mammals, nor egg production in birds, reduces lifespan in the absence of such stress. If genetically based or other intrinsic antagonistic pleiotropy underlies the evolution of senescence, it was not evident in our analyses.},

@article{Kirkwood1979,
abstract = {Ageing is not adaptive since it reduces reproductive potential, and the argument that it evolved to provide offspring with living space is hard to sustain for most species. An alternative theory is based on the recognition that the force of natural selection declines with age, since in most environments individuals die from predation, disease or starvation. Ageing could therefore be the combined result of late-expressed deleterious genes which are beyond the reach of effective negative selection. However, this argument is circular, since the concept of 'late expression' itself implies the prior existence of adult age-related physiological processes. Organisms that do not age are essentially in a steady state in which chronologically young and old individuals are physiologically the same. In this situation the synthesis of macromolecules must be sufficiently accurate to prevent error feedback and the development of lethal 'error catastrophes'. This involves the expenditure of energy, which is required for both kinetic proof-reading and other accuracy promoting devices. It may be selectively advantageous for higher organisms to adopt an energy saving strategy of reduced accuracy in somatic cells to accelerate development and reproduction, but the consequence will be eventual deterioration and death. This 'disposable soma' theory of the evolution of ageing also proposes that a high level of accuracy is maintained in immortal germ line cells, or alternatively, that any defective germ cells are eliminated. The evolution of an increase in longevity in mammals may be due to a concomitant reduction in the rates of growth and reproduction and an increase in the accuracy of synthesis of macromolecules. The theory can be tested by measuring accuracy in germ line and somatic cells and also by comparing somatic cells from mammals with different longevities.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to clarify the relationships between environmental conditions and physiological constraints that persist during the evolution of a species on the one hand, and the strategies of energy investment used by an individual to repair on the other. We take as a basis for our study the evolutionary optimization approach and use as a criterion of optimality the individual's lifetime reproductive success. Using methods of mathematical theory of optimal control, we calculated some optimal strategies of energy partition between repair, current survival and reproduction for various levels of uncontrollable (external) mortality. The results are presented in the form of dependencies of mortality on age and dependencies of optimal energy partitioning on age and accumulated mortality risk. Three cases of energy partitioning were considered: that between reproduction and current survival, that between reproduction and repair, and that between current survival and repair. In the case of the trade- off between reproduction and current survival, we noted opposite influences of the levels of increase of uncontrollable and controllable sources of mortality on the strategy of energy partitioning, and the crucial role of the finiteness of maximum lifespan when age-independent sources of mortality only were present. In the case of the trade-off between reproduction and repair, we noted that controllable repair leads to the emergence of accelerated growth of mortality with age, which may be considered one possible cause of the accelerated ageing often observed in nature and expressed sometimes in the form of a Gompertz-Makeham equation. In the case of the trade-off between current survival and repair, we found that, in the case of increasing mortality, repair is sacrificed not only in favour of reproduction, but also in favour of current survival, so that accelerated ageing should be expected even when investment in reproduction does not increase with age. In general, we conclude that when mortality increases, the priority when expending energy is shifted primarily in favour of reproduction, then in favour of current survival, with repair having the lowest priority.},

The concept of long-run growth rate of a population is explained and extended to age-structured populations. Diffusion approximations show how stochastic factors affect extinction in single populations and metapopulations. Delayed density dependence in populations with discrete annual reproduction is estimated from time series of adult numbers combined with basic life history data. The spatial scale of population fluctuations and local extinction risk depend on the scales of spatial environmental autocorrelation and individual dispersal, and the strength of density dependence. Stochastic dynamics and statistical uncertainty in population parameters are incorporated in Population Viability Analysis and sustainable harvesting. Statistics of species diversity measures and species abundance distributions are described, with implications for rapid assessments of biodiversity, and methods are developed for partitioning species diversity into components. Analysis of stochastic community dynamics indicates that real communities are far from neutral.},

abstract = {Background: The gamma-Gompertz model is a fixed frailty model in which baseline mortality increases exponentially with age, frailty has a proportional effect on mortality, and frailty at birth follows a gamma distribution. Mortality selects against the more frail, so the marginal mortality rate decelerates, eventually reaching an asymptote. The gamma-Gompertz is one of a wider class of frailty models, characterized by the choice of baseline mortality, effects of frailty, distributions of frailty, and assumptions about the dynamics of frailty. Objective: To develop a matrix model to compute all the statistical properties of longevity from the gamma-Gompertz and related models. Methods: I use the vec-permutation matrix formulation to develop a model in which individuals are jointly classified by age and frailty. The matrix is used to project the age and frailty dynamics of a cohort and the fundamental matrix is used to obtain the statistics of longevity. Results: The model permits calculation of the mean, variance, coefficient of variation, skewness and all moments of longevity, the marginal mortality and survivorship functions, the dynamics of the frailty distribution, and other quantities. The matrix formulation extends naturally to other frailty models. I apply the analysis to the gamma-Gompertz model (for humans and laboratory animals), the gamma-Makeham model, and the gamma-Siler model, and to a hypothetical dynamic frailty model characterized by diffusion of frailty with reflecting boundaries. The matrix model permits partitioning the variance in longevity into components due to heterogeneity and to individual stochasticity. In several published human data sets, heterogeneity accounts for less than 10{\%} of the variance in longevity. In laboratory populations of five invertebrate animal species, heterogeneity accounts for 46{\%} to 83{\%} of the total variance in longevity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Hal Caswell.},

In a fluctuating environment, evolution maximizes a function of growth rate, carrying capacity and environmental variance, tending to r-selection and K-selection under large and small environmental noise, respectively. Here we analyze a model in which birth- and death-rates depend on den- sity through the same function but with independent strength of density dependence. As a special case, both functions may be lin- ear, corresponding to logistic dynamics. It is shown that evolution maximizes a function of the deterministic growth rate r0 and the lifetime reproductive success (LRS) R0, both defined at small den- sities, as well as the environmental variance. Under large noise this function is dominated by r0 and average lifetimes are small, while R0 dominates and lifetimes are larger under small noise. Thus, K- selection is closely linked to selection for large R0 so that evolution tends to maximize LRS in a stable high densities, respectively, favouring density-dependent changes in the optimal life history environment. Consequently, different quantities (r0 and R0) tend to be maximized at low and},

Yet, studies of "population momentum" are restricted in the sense that they describe the inertia of population size resulting from a demographic transition to the stationary population growth rate. Although rarely mentioned, inertia in population size is a general phenomenon and can be produced by any demographic transition or perturbation. Because population size is of central importance in demography, conservation, and management, formulas relating the sensitivity of population inertia to changes in underlying vital rates and population structure could provide much-needed insight into the dynamics of populations with unstable (st)age structure. Here, we derive such formulas, which are readily computable, and provide examples of their potential use in studies of life history and applied arenas of population study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To what extent are the determinants of aging in animal species universal? Insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling (IIS) is an evolutionarily conserved (public) regulator of longevity; yet it remains unclear whether the genes and biochemical processes through which IIS acts on aging are public or private (that is, lineage specific). To address this, we have applied a novel, multi-level cross-species comparative analysis to compare gene expression changes accompanying increased longevity in mutant nematodes, fruitflies and mice with reduced IIS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Surprisingly, there is little evolutionary conservation at the level of individual, orthologous genes or paralogous genes under IIS regulation. However, a number of gene categories are significantly enriched for genes whose expression changes in long-lived animals of all three species. Down-regulated categories include protein biosynthesis-associated genes. Up-regulated categories include sugar catabolism, energy generation, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and several other categories linked to cellular detoxification (that is, phase 1 and phase 2 metabolism of xenobiotic and endobiotic toxins). Protein biosynthesis and GST activity have recently been linked to aging and longevity assurance, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: These processes represent candidate, regulated mechanisms of longevity-control that are conserved across animal species. The longevity assurance mechanisms via which IIS acts appear to be lineage-specific at the gene level (private), but conserved at the process level (or semi-public). In the case of GSTs, and cellular detoxification generally, this suggests that the mechanisms of aging against which longevity assurance mechanisms act are, to some extent, lineage specific.},

abstract = {The theory of optimal reproductive strategies has traditionally been studied in two ways: formal analysis of simple models that neglect the effects of age structure, and computer studies of complex life histories. Each of these approaches has disadvantages. The consequences of simple models sometimes depend more on the nature of the simplifying assumptions than on the biological issues in question. On the other hand, computer simulations are only as general as the examples considered. The present study seeks to extend the formal analysis of optimal life histories to complex cases. I show that an optimal life history maximizes for each age class the expected fecundity at that age plus the sum of all future expected fecundities, each discounted by an appropriate power of e-" where m is Fisher's Malthusian parameter. This result enables us to determine, at least in the case of a three-stage life history, the manner in which the optimal reproductive effort at each age depends on the efforts made at the other ages, and thus, the coevolution of the various age-specific efforts. Three cases are distinguished: (1) If fertility and post-breeding survival and growth are concave functions of reproductive effort (i.e., have second derivatives that are everywhere negative) there is a single set of age-specific reproductive rates to which the system evolves regardless of initial conditions. This set of reproductive rates corresponds to an iteroparous life history (repeated breeding at different ages). (2) On the other hand, if fertility and subsequent growth and survival are convex functions of effort (positive second derivatives), semelparity (a single, herculean reproductive effort, followed by death) will most often evolve. However, an alternative, iteroparous life history sometimes exists, although stability considerations suggest that it may be transitory. ( 3 ) More realistic fertility and growth survival functions can generate alternative reproductive strategies that are stable since each represents a local maximum in fitness. Often one of these alternatives corresponds to semelparity, the second to repeated reproduction. In such cases, the evolutionary outcome depends on initial conditions. This suggests that related species, with similar ecologies, may have very different life histories, the differences resulting from historical accidents that have trapped each on a different adaptive peak. The Salmonid genera, Salmo and Oncorhynchus, are suggested as possible examples.},

In general, it is fair to assume that increasing reproductive effort at any age will enhance fecundity at that age but reduce postbreeding survival and growth (Barnes 1962, Tinkle 1969, Hussell 1972).

analytical treatment is needed (because simulations dont bring much, and induce errors)




-              Schaffer : The complexity of former trade-off typology based on constraint location and the confusion it lead to can be exemplified using the seminal paper from (Schaffer 1974). In this article, he extended the results of early optimal life-history analysis (e.g. (Charnov and Schaffer 1973) where vital rates are constant, towards an age structure. Because he defines survival and fertility as functions of reproductive effort (“percent allocation of resources to breeding”), this article was considered at the time as an analysis of “physiological costs”, and still is by some eminent ecologists (e.g. L. Lehman during questions/discussion at CFD Coste's thesis defense (Coste 2017)). This is wrong for two reasons. First because it is anachronic : early life-historians used to designate trade-offs as physiological (or internal) by contrast with ecological (or external) i.e. based on the role of the environment on the trade-off and not, as currently used by evolutionary ecologists, on the position of the constraint distinguishing physiological (or mechanistic) trade-off from genetic (or evolutionary) trade-offs (Braendle, Heyland, and Flatt 2011). Second, because in that case, there is not even a debate on whether the trade-offs is the genetic component or the indivudal component of a physiological trade-off : as Schaffer puts it himself (in brackets ??) : “ [Effort can be removed from the graphs by treating b and pg as functions of each other (MacArthur, personal communication, also Emlen 1970, Charnov and Krebs 1974). {\ldots}]” i.e. the trade-off may as well be ecological (external) : What schaffer and his predecessors are studying is the genetic component of the costs of reproduction (optimality theory)},

abstract = {Reproduction shortens lifespan in practically all organisms examined so far, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown to date. Here I review what evolutionary and molecular biologists have learned about such "costs of reproduction" in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) since Maynard Smith's (1958) seminal discovery that sterile mutants in D. subobscura live substantially longer than fertile wildtype flies. Together with observations from the nematode worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) and other organisms, the data from Drosophila suggest that there are at least four general principles that underlie trade-offs between reproduction and lifespan: (1) trade-offs between survival and reproduction are widespread; (2) the relationship between increased lifespan and decreased fecundity can be uncoupled under certain conditions; (3) while survival costs of reproduction might not necessarily be due to competitive resource allocation, we lack robust alternative explanations for their occurrence; and (4) physiological trade-offs between reproduction and longevity do not always translate into evolutionary genetic trade-offs. I conclude that - despite much recent progress - our current understanding of the proximate basis of survival costs of reproduction remains very limited; much future work on the genetics and physiology of such trade-offs will be required to uncover their mechanistic basis. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Theoretical studies of life history evolution almost unanimously incorporate some form of tradeoff between life history variables, such as reduced parental survival due to increased reproductive effort. These tradeoffs, or costs of reproduction, are fundamental in predicting the optimal life history in any given environment. The importance of such costs in theoretical models has motivated researchers to check that they exist by seeking an association between some component of reproductive effort, such as fecundity, and some form of cost, such as parental survival. Four methods have been used for making these evaluations: 1) Phenotypic correlations, where some index of reproductive effort is correlated with a potential cost, 2) Experimental manipulations, where reproduction is directly manipulated and a cost-related response is measured, 3) Genetic correlations, where formal quantitative genetic designs are used to estimate the genetic correlation between some component of reproductive effort and some component of cost, and 4) Correlated responses to selection, where artificial selection causes correlated changes in reproductive effort and some component of costs. Because the theoretical studies are models of evolution, I argue that a relevant empirical study must deal with genetically based tradeoffs. By this criterion, only the last two methods (which represent a small minority of the reviewed studies) properly address the "costs" dealt with by theoreticians; however, this evaluation is not intended as a litmus test for the merits of a given approach to the problem. I discuss both the important contributions of the first two methods to our understanding of the costs of reproduction and the limitations of the last two methods in assessing "costs". /// Ð¢ÐµÐ¾{\~{N}}€Ðµ{\~{N}}‚Ð¸{\~{N}}‡Ðµ{\~{N}} Ð{\textordmasculine}Ð¸Ðµ Ð¸{\~{N}} {\~{N}} Ð»ÐµÐ´Ð¾Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¸{\~{N}} {\~{N}} Ð²Ð¾Ð»{\~{N}}{\v{Z}}{\~{N}}†Ð¸Ð¸ Ð{\P}Ð¸Ð{\textperiodcentered}Ð½ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ {\~{N}}†Ð¸Ð{\textordmasculine}Ð»Ð° Ð¿Ð¾{\~{N}}‡{\~{N}}‚Ð¸ ÐµÐ´Ð¸Ð½Ð¾Ð´{\~{N}}ƒ{\~{N}}ˆÐ½Ð¾ Ð²Ð{\textordmasculine}Ð»{\~{N}}{\v{Z}}{\~{N}}‡Ð°-{\~{N}}{\v{Z}}{\~{N}}‚ Ð½ÐµÐ{\textordmasculine}{\~{N}}ƒ{\~{N}}{\v{Z}} {\~{N}}„Ð¾{\~{N}}€Ð¼{\~{N}}ƒ Ð{\textordmasculine}Ð¾Ð¼Ð¿ÐµÐ½{\~{N}} Ð°{\~{N}}†Ð¸Ð¸ Ð¾{\~{N}}‚Ð´ÐµÐ»{\~{N}}{\OE}Ð½{\~{N}}‹{\~{N}}{\ldots} Ð¿Ðµ{\~{N}}€ÐµÐ¼ÐµÐ½Ð½{\~{N}}‹{\~{N}}{\ldots} Ð{\P}Ð¸Ð{\textperiodcentered}Ð½ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ {\~{N}}†Ð¸Ð{\textordmasculine}Ð»Ð°, {\~{N}}‚Ð°Ð{\textordmasculine}Ð¸{\~{N}}{\ldots} Ð{\textordmasculine}Ð°Ð{\textordmasculine} {\~{N}} Ð½Ð¸Ð{\P}ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ Ð²{\~{N}}‹Ð{\P}Ð¸Ð²Ð°ÐµÐ¼Ð¾{\~{N}} {\~{N}}‚Ð¸ {\~{N}}€Ð¾Ð´Ð¸{\~{N}}‚ÐµÐ»ÐµÐ¹ Ð² {\~{N}}€ÐµÐ{\textperiodcentered}{\~{N}}ƒÐ»{\~{N}}{\OE}{\~{N}}‚Ð°{\~{N}}‚Ðµ Ð¿Ð¾Ð²{\~{N}}{\OE}{\~{N}}ˆÐµÐ½Ð¸{\~{N}} {\~{N}}€ÐµÐ¿{\~{N}}€Ð¾Ð´{\~{N}}ƒÐ{\textordmasculine}{\~{N}}‚Ð¸Ð²Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¿Ð¾Ð¿{\~{N}}‹{\~{N}}‚-Ð{\textordmasculine}Ð¸.

abstract = {The proposed equivalence of maximizing reproductive value and fitness is examined for two model life histories. In the first instance, it is assumed that offspring are fledged before the start of the next breeding season. In this case the proposed equivalence is verified. In the second model, parents care for their progeny for more than 1 year. In this case the optimal reproductive expenditure at a particular age is shown to depend on both current reproductive value and the diminution in survival rates of previously conceived young still dependent on parental protection.},

abstract = {The common finding that juvenile male mammals show higher mortality than females 1,2 is usually attributed either to the expression of deleterious recessive alleles on the X chromosome 3 or to adaptive manipulation of the postnatal sex ratio by mothers who are unable to rear successful sons 4,5 . As a general explanation of differential juvenile mortality, the first of these two theories is unsatisfactory because increased male mortality is known to occur in several bird species where females are the heterogametic sex 6,7 . The second hypothesis was first proposed by Trivers and Willard 4 and suggests that differential mortality should occur early in the period of parental investment 8 . We now show that, although several predictions of the latter explanation are fulfilled, the distribution of differential mortality in red deer and other mammals suggests that higher mortality rates among male juveniles are a consequence of a greater susceptibility of males to food shortage associated with their faster growth rates and increased nutritional requirements.},

abstract = {Populations in variable environments are described by both a mean growth rate and a variance of stochastic population growth. Increasing variance will increase the width of confidence bounds around estimates of population size, growth, probability of and time to quasi-extinction. However, traditional sensitivity analyses of stochastic matrix models only consider the sensitivity of the mean growth rate. We derive an exact method for calculating the sensitivity of the variance in population growth to changes in demographic parameters. Sensitivities of the variance also allow a new sensitivity calculation for the cumulative probability of quasi-extinction. We apply this new analysis tool to an empirical dataset on at-risk polar bears to demonstrate its utility in conservation biology. We find that in many cases a change in life history parameters will increase both the mean and variance of population growth of polar bears. This counterintuitive behaviour of the variance complicates predictions about overall population impacts of management interventions. Sensitivity calculations for cumulative extinction risk factor in changes to both mean and variance, providing a highly useful quantitative tool for conservation management. The mean stochastic growth rate and its sensitivities do not fully describe the dynamics of population growth. The use of variance sensitivities gives a more complete understanding of population dynamics and facilitates the calculation of new sensitivities for extinction processes.},

abstract = {It is well known that for an isolated population, the probability of extinction is positively related to population size variation: more variation is associated with more extinction. What, then, is the relation of extinction to population size variation for a population embedded in a metapopulation and subjected to repeated extinction and recolonization? In this case, the extinction risk can be measured by the extinction rate, the frequency at which local extinction occurs. Using several population dynamics models with immigration, we find, in general, a negative correlation between extinction and variation. More precisely, with increasing length of the time series, an initially negative regression coefficient first becomes more negative, then becomes less negative, and eventually attains positive values before decreasing again to 0. This pattern holds under substantial variation in values of parameters representing species and environmental properties. It is also rather robust to census interval length and the fraction of missed individuals but fails to hold for high thresholds (population size values below which extinction is deemed to occur) when quasi extinction rather than true extinction is represented. The few departures from the initial negative correlation correspond to populations at risk: low growth rate or frequent catastrophes.},

abstract = {A number of indices exist to calculate lifespan variation, each with different underlying properties. Here, we present new formulae for the response of seven of these indices to changes in the underlying mortality schedule (life disparity, Gini coefficient, standard deviation, variance, Theil's index, mean logarithmic deviation, and interquartile range). We derive each of these indices from an absorbing Markov chain formulation of the life table, and use matrix calculus to obtain the sensitivity and the elasticity (i.e., the proportional sensitivity) to changes in age-specific mortality. Using empirical French and Russian male data, we compare the underlying sensitivities to mortality change under different mortality regimes to determine the conditions under which the indices might differ in their conclusions about the magnitude of lifespan variation. Finally, we demonstrate how the sensitivities can be used to decompose temporal changes in the indices into contributions of age-specific mortality changes. The result is an easily computable method for calculating the properties of this important class of longevity indices.},

abstract = {When analysing how individuals allocate resources, sexual display should be regarded as is any other life-history trait: patterns of allocation are expected to be individually optimised. It thus follows that the costs of sexual selection cannot be studied by simply comparing unmanipulated individual effort and some measure of cost. This rather trivial consequence of life-history theory has received surprisingly little attention in studies of sexual selection despite the almost universal acceptance of the theory and the fact that several papers have addressed the question specifically in the context of sexual selection. We therefore again outline why sexual displays are expected to be optimised at the level of the individual and why individuals with high access to resources should generally display at higher levels than individuals short of resources, We use some recent findings from studies of birds and spiders particularly relevant to the above questions that illustrate these principles. The examples we present show that the cost of sexual selection could be mediated in many ways and we thus suggest that future studies should focus on such mechanisms.

@article{Gould1979,
abstract = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past 40 years. It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an oragnism into unitary 'traits' and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with Baupl{\"{a}}ne so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain why they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures. We support Darwin's own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary change.},

@misc{Bull1985,
abstract = {Evolutionary biology commonly addresses how and why organisms change. It also addresses how and why they do not change. Some types of change do not occur because of constraints—the evolution is simply prevented. The limitations on organic evolution are necessarily to be found at the levels of phenotypic variation, inheritance, and selection, just as the process of evolutionary change is also to be understood at these levels. Although some im portant constraints have already been discovered at these levels (e.g., inheritance is often Mendelian), further observations are needed in developing a comprehensive theory of evolutionary restrictions. An extreme type of evolutionary restriction is irreversibility—the inability of a population to reacquire a (recent) ancestral state; this is sometimes known as Dollo's law (Simpson, 1953; Dobzhan- sky, 1970; Gould, 1970; see Discussion for a review). As a biological problem, irreversibility has two features distinguishing it from the much larger class of general evolutionary restrictions. First, irreversibility involves restrictions with respect to a small set of phenotypes: the known ancestors. Second, since the unattainable phenotypes previously existed in the lineage, the restrictions result from the present characteristics of the population rather than from any intrinsic limitation of the species. Both of these features render irreversibility more amenable to analysis than evolutionary restrictions in general, and by developing a thorough understanding of irreversibility, insights to other classes of evolutionary restrictions may be obtained as a consequence. This paper describes several phenotypic states that may exhibit evolutionary irreversibility. In acknowledging the existing literature on irreversibility, the analysis here differs from most previous treatments in two ways: i) The present examples are chiefly of genetic systems rather than morphological characters. ii) The underlying basis of irreversibility is identified from patterns of variation and selection—proposing why the transition to the ancestral state is unlikely-rather than inferring irreversibility from phyletic comparisons. Later in this paper we relax the requirement that the unattainable phenotypic states previously existed in the lineage and address a class of restricted transitions somewhat broader than strict irreversibility},

abstract = {As the world grows less biologically diverse, it is becoming less linguistically and culturally diverse as well. Biologists estimate annual loss of species at 1,000 times or more greater than historic rates, and linguists predict that 50-90{\%} of the world's languages will disappear by the end of this century. Prior studies indicate similarities in the geographic arrangement of biological and linguistic diversity, although conclusions have often been constrained by use of data with limited spatial precision. Here we use greatly improved datasets to explore the co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity in regions containing many of the Earth's remaining species: biodiversity hotspots and high biodiversity wilderness areas. Results indicate that these regions often contain considerable linguistic diversity, accounting for 70{\%} of all languages on Earth. Moreover, the languages involved are frequently unique (endemic) to particular regions, with many facing extinction. Likely reasons for co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity are complex and appear to vary among localities, although strong geographic concordance between biological and linguistic diversity in many areas argues for some form of functional connection. Languages in high biodiversity regions also often co-occur with one or more specific conservation priorities, here defined as endangered species and protected areas, marking particular localities important for maintaining both forms of diversity. The results reported in this article provide a starting point for focused research exploring the relationship between biological and linguistic-cultural diversity, and for developing integrated strategies designed to conserve species and languages in regions rich in both.},

abstract = {Challenging as it typically is, the estimation of parameter values seems to be an unavoidable step in the design and implementation of any dynamic model. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to set up, diagnose, and simulate dynamic models without the need to estimate parameter values, if the situation is favorable. Specifically, it is possible to establish nonparametric models for nonlinear compartment models, including metabolic pathway models, if sufficiently many high-quality time series data are available that describe the biological phenomenon under investigation in an appropriate and representative manner. The proposed nonparametric strategy is a variant of the method of Dynamic Flux Estimation (DFE), which permits the estimation of numerical flux profiles from metabolic time series data. However, instead of attempting to formulate these numerical profiles as explicit functions and to optimize their parameter values, as it is done in DFE, the metabolite and flux profiles are used here directly as a scaffold for a library from which values are interpolated and retrieved for the simulation of the differential equations describing the model. Beyond simulations, the proposed methods render it possible to determine steady states from non-steady state data, perform sensitivity analyses, and estimate the Jacobian of the system at a steady state.},

abstract = {Aging or senescence is an age-dependent decline in physiological function, demographically manifest as decreased survival and fecundity with increasing age. Since aging is disadvantageous it should not evolve by natural selection. So why do organisms age and die? In the 1940s and 1950s evolutionary geneticists resolved this paradox by positing that aging evolves because selection is inefficient at maintaining function late in life. By the 1980s and 1990s this evolutionary theory of aging had received firm empirical support, but little was known about the mechanisms of aging. Around the same time biologists began to apply the tools of molecular genetics to aging and successfully identified mutations that affect longevity. Today, the molecular genetics of aging is a burgeoning field, but progress in evolutionary genetics of aging has largely stalled. Here we argue that some of the most exciting and unresolved questions about aging require an integration of molecular and evolutionary approaches. Is aging a universal process? Why do species age at different rates? Are the mechanisms of aging conserved or lineage-specific? Are longevity genes identified in the laboratory under selection in natural populations? What is the genetic basis of plasticity in aging in response to environmental cues and is this plasticity adaptive? What are the mechanisms underlying trade-offs between early fitness traits and life span? To answer these questions evolutionary biologists must adopt the tools of molecular biology, while molecular biologists must put their experiments into an evolutionary framework. The time is ripe for a synthesis of molecular biogerontology and the evolutionary biology of aging. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Relative to N2, the mutants clk-1 and daf-2 extended average life span by 27{\%} and 111{\%}, respectively, but reduced net reproductive rate by 44{\%} and 18{\%}. The net result of differences in survival and fertility was a significant differential in fitness, with both clk-1 (lambda = 2.74) and daf-2 (lambda = 3.78) at a disadvantage relative to N2 (lambda = 3.85). Demographic life table response experiment (LTRE) analysis revealed that the fitness differentials were due to negative effects in mutants on reproduction in the first 6-7 days of life. Fitness costs in clk-1 and daf-2 of C. elegans are consistent with the theory of antagonistic pleiotropy for the evolution of senescence.},

abstract = {Life history theory accounts for variations in many traits involved in the reproduction and survival of living organisms, by determining the constraints leading to trade-offs among these different traits. The main life history traits of phages—viruses that infect bacteria—are the multiplication rate in the host, the survivorship of virions in the external environment, and their mode of transmission. By comparing life history traits of 16 phages infecting the bacteria Escherichia coli, we show that their mortality rate is constant with time and negatively correlated to their multiplication rate in the bacterial host. Even though these viruses do not age, this result is in line with the trade-off between survival and reproduction previously observed in numerous aging organisms. Furthermore, a multiple regression shows that the combined effects of two physical parameters, namely, the capsid thickness and the density of the packaged genome, account for 82{\%} of the variation in the mortality rate. The correlations between life history traits and physical characteristics of virions may provide a mechanistic explanation of this trade-off. The fact that this trade-off is present in this very simple biological situation suggests that it might be a fundamental property of evolving entities produced under constraints. Moreover, such a positive correlation between mortality and multiplication reveals an underexplored trade-off in host–parasite interactions.},

In this study the Beverton and Holt invariants were obtained from maximization of the fecundity function that optimizes the trade-off between survival and fecundity; this approach applies conventional fishery models and provides estimates of the constants C1, C2, and C3. These estimates can be compared with the estimates obtained by regression of 1/M on xm, M on K, and L(xm) on Linf across species and across populations within species. The values of the constants obtained from regression across species agree closely with the theoretical values of the constants. In fishery assessments, natural mortality is often approximated using growth parameters, and the analyses reported here indicate that the relations are not just statistical relations, but rather result from fundamental ecological relations among the parameters.},

The population of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in the Camargue (Rhone River Delta, France) is annual, all adults dying after their first breeding season. As the three-spined stickleback is a multiple spawner, we tested the hypothesis that reproductive effort may increase during the breeding season on field data. From 1987 to 1998, 653 female sticklebacks were collected in the field during the breeding seasons. The body size, body weight and weights of the liver, gonads and carcass were measured for these individuals. Only gravid females with mature eggs (176 fish) were included in the analysis. Considering the female three-spined stickleback as a capital breeder, the energetic resources available for allocation between soma and gonads were estimated by its body weight. Somatic condition decreased during the breeding season and reproductive effort (gonad weight relative to body weight) increased. These patterns did not vary significantly between years. These observed variations in reproductive effort during the breeding season can be interpreted as empirical evidence of a trade-off between reproductive effort and expectation of future reproduction.},

Different classes of tradeoffs are known to constrain the evolution of phenotypes, but current theories incorporate only a subset of these tradeoffs. Consequently, these theories cannot account for some of the variation in reaction norms that has been observed within and among species. Empirical studies of thermal reaction norms for physiological and life historical traits have shown that different proximate mechanisms can produce similar reaction norms. As a consequence, certain tradeoffs can be circumvented when the fitness costs imposed by these tradeoffs are severe. We argue that a unified theory that includes all classes of tradeoffs would provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that drive the evolution of reaction norms.},

abstract = {For density-independent populations, the sensitivity of population growth rate to changes in individual vital rates indicates the strength of selection on different parts of the life history. Here I show how this approach may be extended to any density-dependent and/or stochastic population model, including those that show cyclic, quasi-periodic and chaotic dynamics. One calculates the influence of individual vital rates on the outcome of competition between two almost identical life histories. The outcome of this competition is determined by the invasion exponent theta introduced by Rand. This is the Lyapunov exponent of the linearized system describing the invasion of a population With one life history by a variant type with another. Demographic sensitivities are given by the partial derivatives of theta with respect to the individual vital rates of the invading type. The density-independent analysis is a special case of this general framework. Sensitivities can often be obtained analytically when the population has a stable equilibrium point, and can be calculated by numerical differentiation in other cases. One can also use the methodology to examine selection pressures on the parameters describing density dependence and, if there are trade-offs between vital rates, it can be used to determine optimal life histories. A two age-class example shows that the occurrence of nonlinear dynamics can markedly alter selection pressures on a life history from those which operate when the population has a stable equilibrium point.},

In this paper we present an analysis of a stage-structured model, and prove that the model's structure can be simplified and parameterised in such a way that the long-term growth rate, the stable-stage distribution and the generation time are all invariant to the simplification. We further show that for certain structures of model the simplified models require less effort in data collection. We also discuss features of the models which are not invariant to the simplification and the implications of our results for the selection of an appropriate model. We illustrate the ideas using a population model for short-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris). In this example, model simplification can increase parameter elasticity, indicating that an intermediate level of complexity is likely to be preferred. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The model quantifies the sources of mortality in these classical problems into vitality-dependent and independent parts, and characterizes the vitality-dependent part in terms of initial and evolving heterogeneities. Three temporal scales express the balance of these factors: a time scale of death from senescence, a time scale of accidental mortality and a crossover time between evolving vs. initial heterogeneity.

We analyzed the statics and dynamics of reproduction and survival in a wild population of the northern fulmar, Fulmarus glacialis (Procellaridae). Survival rate is most influenced by year as compared to age and cohort. When temporal variation is ignored, survival rate increases slowly with age and then declines more rapidly at late ages. Survival rate contingent upon reproductive ‘stratum' (producing an egg, hatching an egg, fledg- ing a hatchling) also exhibits this pattern. Survival and reproduction have a positive static association in that survival rate increases as the apparent energy allocated to reproduction increases (as indexed by stratum). Tere is a broad distribution of realized lifetime reproductive success, which could be due to ‘fixed' heterogeneity, with some individuals always having low survival and reproduction and others always having high survival and reproduction, or be due to ‘dynamic' heterogene- ity, with all individuals having the same expected reproductive and survival rates. Analysis of stochastic stratum dynamics indicates that individuals do not remain long in any given stratum and suggest that the variation among individuals with respect to lifetime reproductive success is due to dynamic heterogeneity. Te probability of producing an egg increases with age for both sexes, whereas the probability of producing a fledgling initially declines with age and then increases. Tese results underscore the necessity of understanding the static and dynamic expression of demographic traits when making a causal claim about their evolution.

abstract = {Canalization is the suppression of phenotypic variation. Depending on the causes of phenotypic variation, one speaks either of genetic or environmental canalization. Genetic canalization describes insensitivity of a character to mutations, and the insensitivity to environmental factors is called environmental canalization. Genetic canalization is of interest because it influences the availability of heritable phenotypic variation to natural selection, and is thus potentially important in determining the pattern of phenotypic evolution. In this paper a number of population genetic models are considered of a quantitative character under stabilizing selection. The main purpose of this study is to define the population genetic conditions and constraints for the evolution of canalization. Environmental canalization is modeled as genotype specific environmental variance. It is shown that stabilizing selection favors genes that decrease environmental variance of quantitative characters. However, the theoretical limit of zero environmental variance has never been observed. Of the many ways to explain this fact, two are addressed by our model. It is shown that a 'canalization limit' is reached if canalizing effects of mutations are correlated with direct effects on the same character. This canalization limit is predicted to be independent of the strength of stabilizing selection, which is inconsistent with recent experimental data (Sterns et al. 1995). The second model assumes that the canalizing genes have deleterious pleiotropic effects. If these deleterious effects are of the same magnitude as all the other mutations affecting fitness very strong stabilizing selection is required to allow the evolution of environmental canalization. Genetic canalization is modeled as an influence on the average effect of mutations at a locus of other genes. It is found that the selection for genetic canalization critically depends on the amount of genetic variation present in the population. The more genetic variation, the stronger the selection for canalizing effects. All factors that increase genetic variation favor the evolution of genetic canalization (large population size, high mutation rate, large number of genes). If genetic variation is maintained by mutation-selection balance, strong stabilizing selection can inhibit the evolution of genetic canalization. Strong stabilizing selection eliminates genetic variation to a level where selection for canalization does not work anymore. It is predicted that the most important characters (in terms of fitness) are not necessarily the most canalized ones, if they are under very strong stabilizing selection (k {\textgreater} 0.2 Ve). The rate of decrease of mutational variance Vm is found to be less than 10{\%} of the initial Vm. From this result it is concluded that characters with typical mutational variances of about 10-3 Ve are in a metastable state where further evolution of genetic canalization is too slow to be of importance at a microevolutionary time scale. The implications for the explanation of macroevolutionary patterns are discussed. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1997 Society for the Study of Evolution},

abstract = {THE battle, which raged for so long between the theories of evolution supported by geneticists on one hand and by naturalists on the other, has in recent years gone strongly in favour of the former. Few biologists now doubt that genetical investigation has revealed at any rate the most important categories of hereditary variation ; and the classical ‘naturalist' theory-the inheritance of acquired characters-has been very generally relegated to the background because, in the forms in which it has been put forward, it has required a type of hereditary variation for the existence of which there was no adequate evidence. The long popularity of the theory was based, not on any positive evidence for it, but on its usefulness in accounting for some of the most striking of the results of evolution. Naturalists cannot fail to be continually and deeply impressed by the adaptation of an organism to its surroundings and of the parts of the organism to each other. These adaptive characters are inherited and some explanation of this must be provided. If we are deprived of the hypothesis of the inheritance of the effects of use and disuse, we seem thrown back on an exclusive reliance on the natural selection of merely chance mutations. It is doubtful, however, whether even the most statistically minded geneticists are entirely satisfied that nothing more is involved than the sorting out of random mutations by the natural selective filter. It is the purpose of this short communication to suggest that recent views on the nature of the developmental process make it easier to understand how the genotypes of evolving organisms can respond to the environment in a more co-ordinated fashion.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Post-reproductive lifespan remains a puzzle for evolutionary biologists. The explanation of increased inclusive fitness through parental care after reproduction that applies for humans is unrealistic for many species. We propose a new selective mechanism, independent of parental care, which relies on the hypothesis that post-reproductive lifespan can evolve as an insurance against indeterminacy: longer life expectancy reduces the risk of dying by chance before the cessation of reproductive activity. We demonstrate numerically that the duration of evolved post-reproductive lifespan is indeed expected to increase with variability in lifespan duration. An unprecedented assay of 11 strains of the collembola Folsomia candida shows the existence of (i) post-reproductive lifespan in the absence of parental care; (ii) genetic variability in mean post-reproductive lifespan and post-reproductive lifespan variability itself; (iii) strong genetic correlation between latter traits. This new explanation brings along the novel idea that loose canalization of a trait (here, somatic lifespan) can itself act as a selective pressure on other traits.},

abstract = {Traditional explanations for the evolution of menopause and post-reproductive lifespan in human females have been based on the benefits of maternal or grand-maternal care outweighing the cost of lost reproduction. These explanations assume an evolutionary origin of menopause since human divergence with the most recent common ancestor. In this study, I conduct a literature survey of studies of 42 mammal species from eight orders, showing that post-reproductive lifespan appears to be widespread among mammals. I then propose an alternative to traditional hypotheses: following accepted theories of trade-offs and senescence, I suggest that the cost of extending reproductive lifespan might be relatively high in female mammals. Somatic and reproductive senescence appear to follow separate trajectories, so it is not surprising that the two processes should occur on different schedules. The timing of each process is probably determined by maximization of reproductive performance and survival early in adulthood, with consequent trajectories resulting in a post-reproductive lifespan. The early end of reproduction relative to lifespan may be due to the cost of production and/or maintenance of oocytes, which decline exponentially over time. Oocyte number below a threshold may trigger an end to normal hormonal cycling.},

abstract = {While menopause has long been known as a characteristic trait of human reproduction, evidence for post-reproductive lifespan (PRLS) has recently been found in other mammals. Adaptive and non-adaptive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of PRLS, but formal tests of these are rare. We use a phylogenetic approach to evaluate hypotheses for the evolution of PRLS among mammals. In contrast to theoretical models predicting that PRLS may be promoted by male philopatry (which increases relatedness between a female and her group in old age), we find little evidence that male philopatry led to the evolution of a post-reproductive period. However, the proportion of life spent post-reproductive was related to lifespan and patterns of philopatry, suggesting that the duration of PRLS may be impacted by both non-adaptive and adaptive processes. Finally, the proportion of females experiencing PRLS was higher in species with male philopaty and larger groups, in accordance with adaptive models of PRLS. We suggest that the origin of PRLS primarily follows the non-adaptive ‘mismatch' scenario, but that patterns of philopatry may subsequently confer adaptive benefits of late-life helping.},

Models where age-specific mutations have pleiotropic effects on mortality that extend either throughout adult life, or are confined to juvenile stages, produce equilibria with exponential increases in the mean and additive variance of mortality rates during much of adult life. However, the rates of increase diminish late in life, and can even become zero. Predictions concerning the additive genetic correlations in mortality rates between different ages are also developed.

abstract = {Aging processes are defined as those that increase the susceptibility of individuals as they grow older to the factors that may cause death. Various possible theories of aging are considered, and evidence that may help to decide between them is discussed. Changes in different organ systems may be merely symptoms of some single aging process, or they may be largely independent and synchronized by natural selection. Even if different organ systems age independently, they may do so as a result of similar changes at a cellular level. Cellular theories of aging may have to take into account the effects of selection between the cells in a tissue. The effects of radiation and somatic mutation theories of aging are discussed. It is suggested that radiation shortens life by inducing somatic mutations but that normal aging is not to any important extent caused by somatic mutations, although it may result from changes in cells that have effects on the physiology of the individual similar to those of somatic mutations. Evidence is presented that in Drosophila and in mice there are two phases in the life-span. In Drosophila, there is an initial "aging" phase, which is irreversible and occurs at a rate approximately independent of temperature, and a second "dying" phase, which is temperature-dependent in rate and reversible at lower temperatures.

abstract = {Two classic theories maintain that aging evolves either because of alleles whose deleterious effects are confined to late life or because of alleles with broad pleiotropic effects that increase early-life fitness at the expense of late-life fitness. However, empirical studies often reveal positive pleiotropy for fitness across age classes, and recent evidence suggests that selection on early-life fitness can decelerate aging and increase lifespan, thereby casting doubt on the current consensus. Here, we briefly review these data and promote the simple argument that aging can evolve under positive pleiotropy between early- and late-life fitness when the deleterious effect of mutations increases with age. We argue that this hypothesis makes testable predictions and is supported by existing evidence.},

abstract = {In age-structured populations, viability and fecundity selection of varying strength may occur in different age classes. On the basis of an original idea by Fisher of weighting individuals by their reproductive value, we show that the combined effect of selection on traits at different ages acts through the individual reproductive value defined as the stochastic contribution of an individual to the total reproductive value of the population the following year. The selection differential is a weighted sum of age-specific differentials that are the covariances between the phenotype and the age-specific relative fitness defined by the individual reproductive value. This enables estimation of weak selection on a multivariate quantitative character in populations with no density regulation by combinations of age-specific linear regressions of individual reproductive values on the traits. Demographic stochasticity produces random variation in fitness components in finite samples of individuals and affects the statistical inference of the temporal average directional selection as well as the magnitude of fluctuating selection. Uncertainties in parameter estimates and test power depend strongly on the demographic stochasticity. Large demographic variance results in large uncertainties in yearly estimates of selection that complicates detection of significant fluctuating selection. The method is illustrated by an analysis of age-specific selection in house sparrows on a fitness-related two-dimensional morphological trait, tarsus length and body mass of fledglings.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to provide students and researchers entering the field of aging studies with an introduction to the evolutionary theories of aging, as well as to orient them in the abundant modern scientific literature on evolutionary gerontology. The following three major evolutionary theories of aging are discussed: 1) the theory of programmed death suggested by August Weismann, 2) the mutation accumulation theory of aging suggested by Peter Medawar, and 3) the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging suggested by George Williams. We also discuss a special case of the antagonistic pleiotropy theory, the disposable soma theory developed by Tom Kirkwood and Robin Holliday. The theories are compared with each other as well as with recent experimental findings. At present the most viable evolutionary theories are the mutation accumulation theory and the antagonistic pleiotropy theory; these theories are not mutually exclusive, and they both may become a part of a future unifying theory of aging. Evolutionary theories of aging are useful because they open new opportunities for further research by suggesting testable predictions, but they have also been harmful in the past when they were used to impose limitations on aging studies. At this time, the evolutionary theories of aging are not ultimate completed theories, but rather a set of ideas that themselves require further elaboration and validation. This theoretical review article is written for a wide readership.},

abstract = {Wright's FST and related statistics are often used to measure the extent of divergence among populations of the same species relative to the net genetic diversity within the species. This paper compares several definitions of FST which are relevant to DNA sequence data, and shows that these must be used with care when estimating migration parameters. It is also pointed out that FST is strongly influenced by the level of within-population diversity. In situations where factors such as selection on closely linked sites are expected to have stronger effects on within-population diversity at some loci than at others, differences among loci can result entirely from differences in within-population diversities. It is shown that several published cases of differences in FST among regions of high and low recombination in Drosophila may be caused in this way. For the purpose of comparisons of levels of between-population differences among loci or species which are subject to different intensities of forces that reduce variability within local populations, absolute measures of divergence between populations should be used in preference to relative measures such as FST.},

abstract = {Letters Palaeobiology: the origin and evolution of a scientific discipline U. Kutschera Institute of Biology, University of Kassel, Heinrich-Plett-Str. 40, D-34109 Kassel, Germany In a recent TREE review, Jackson and Erwin [1] stated that palaeontology was initially concerned with the description of new fossils and that G.G. Simpson's book of 1944 [2] established the modern version of this field, with the focus on fossils as true remnants of once-living (extinct) organisms. According to these authors [1], palaeobiology developed during the 1960s from Simpson's unique synthesis of evolutionary studies and classical palaeontology. This popular view is supported by the first date of publication of the journal Paleobiology, which began in 1975. Here, I show that this assumption is not correct and argue that palaeobiology originated one century ago, with the work of a great, but largely forgotten scientist. In his monograph, Simpson [2] referred to publications of the Austrian palaeontologist Othenio Abel (1875--1946), who I suggest is the founding father of palaeobiology [3]. Unfortunately, his book of 1911, Grundzu¨ ge der Palaeobiologie der Wirbeltiere [4] (Principle of Palaeobiology of Vertebrates), has not been translated into English and, therefore, has remained largely unknown (Figure 1). In the first chapter of his 708 page-long monograph [4], Abel gave the following definition: `Ich fu¨ hre fu¨ r jenen Zweig der Naturwissenschaften, der sich die Erforschung der Anpassungen der fossilen Organismen und die Ermittlung ihrer Lebensweise zur Aufgabe stellt, die Bezeichnung ``Pala¨ obiologie'' ein'. (For the branch of the natural sciences that aims to elucidate the adaptations of fossil organisms and their way of life, I introduce the term `palaeobiology'). Abel also considered palaeobiology to be a `Mittel zur Erforschung stammesgeschichtlicher Zusammenha ¨ nge' (the elucidation of phylogenetic relationships) [4]. In 1906, Abel published a review article on fossil flying fishes [5], where he used essentially the same definition as above [4], but substituted the term `modern palaeontology' instead. In this paper [5], the principle of historical reconstruction is explicitly described for the first time and original fossils and their `revitalized' possible phenotypes are depicted side by side [6]. In numerous additional papers and comprehensive monographs [7,8], Abel described his efforts to reconstruct the ecology and biology of extinct organisms based on the fossils then available. To further consolidate the emerging field of palaeobiology, he founded and edited a new journal, Palaeobiologica: Archiv fu¨ r die Erforschung des Lebens der Vorzeit und seiner Geschichte; the first volume, dedicated to his teacher Louis Dollo (1857--1931), was published in 1928. Unfortunately, the journal did not survive World War II, and last issue was published in 1948. Additional facts support Abel as the first professional palaeobiologist. He held the position of `Full Professor of Palaeobiology (and Palaeontology)' at the Universities of Vienna, Austria (1917--1934) and Go¨ttingen, Germany (1935--1941) [3]. Every second year, the Austrian Academy of Sciences now awards the prestigious `Othenio Abel Prize for Palaeobiology' to an outstanding scientist who has published work `in the wake of O. Abel'. At the University of Vienna, a lecture hall is also named after him (the `Othenio Abel Saal'). There is no question that themodern era of palaeobiology beganthree decades agowith the launchof the journal Palaeobiology and related periodicals (e.g. Historical Biology. An International Journal of Palaeobiology). The `Aims and Scopes' sections of these journals aremuchmore detailed than those published in Abel's now extinct Palaeobiologica [9], in which he wrote that 'das Ziel (ist es), das Leben der Vorzeit der Erdgeschicht im einzelnen Figure 1. Othenio Abel (1875--1946) and the cover of Grundzu¨ge der Palaeobiologie der Wirbeltiere [4]. Corresponding author: Kutschera, U. (kut@uni-kassel.de). Available online 6 February 2007. 172 Update TRENDS in Ecology and Evolution Vol.22 No.4 www.sciencedirect.com wie im ganzen zu verstehen' (the aim is to understand the life of the past with respect to special events and as a whole). In addition, several comments published in articles forming part of the recent `Palaeontology Series' in TREE stem from Abel's comprehensive monographs [4,5,7,8]. Modern palaeobiology sensu Jackson and Erwin [1] evolved from Abel's seminal contributions. It is now an interdisciplinary science concerned with the history of life through geological time and the biology and/or ecology of extinct organisms. It includes palaeobiogeography, taphonomy, extinction events and aspects of geochronology, geophysics and geochemistry. Nevertheless, the outstanding work of Abel [4,5,7--9] is not outdated and, therefore, should still be cited, although this is rarely the case (e.g. Ref. [6]). Abel, the `forgotten Darwin of the Earth Sciences', was the doyen of a scientific discipline that later became one of the pillars of our modern (synthetic) theory of biological evolution [10]. When G.G. Simpson, one of the `architects' of the synthetic theory of 1950, published his book in 1944[2], the rates of evolution were not known, and only a few 'connecting links' in the fossil record had been described. Over the past two decades, palaeobiologists have provided quantitative estimates of mean morphospecies durations for numerous groups of fossil organisms. Moreover, the list of intermediate forms linking major groups of vertebrates has grown considerably [10]. These (and other) findings from modern palaeobiology have contributed to our knowledge of the processes and driving forces of organic evolution, which are summarized in the expanded synthesis -- our grand, unifying theory of the life sciences [10].

abstract = {Selection against deleterious alleles maintained by mutation may cause a reduction in the amount of genetic variability at linked neutral sites. This is because a new neutral variant can only remain in a large population for a long period of time if it is maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious alleles, and hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction below classical neutral values resulting from such background selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity, and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to random-mating populations with no genetic recombination, and to populations reproducing exclusively asexually or by self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating system, the reduction is an exponential function of the total mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the genome involved. Simulations show that the effect decreases rapidly with increasing recombination frequency or rate of outcrossing. The mean time to loss of new neutral mutations and the total number of segregating neutral sites are less sensitive to background selection than the other statistics, unless the population size is of the order of a hundred thousand or more. The stationary distribution of allele frequencies at the neutral sites is correspondingly skewed in favor of rare alleles, compared with the classical neutral result. Observed reductions in molecular variation in low recombination genomic regions of sufficiently large size, for instance in the centromere-proximal regions of Drosophila autosomes or in highly selfing plant populations, may be partly due to background selection against deleterious mutations.},

This deterioration is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Aging research has experienced an unprecedented advance over recent years, particularly with the discovery that the rate of aging is controlled, at least to some extent, by genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. This Review enumerates nine tentative hallmarks that represent common denominators of aging in different organisms, with special emphasis on mammalian aging. These hallmarks are: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. A major challenge is to dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate hallmarks and their relative contributions to aging, with the final goal of identifying pharmaceutical targets to improve human health during aging, with minimal side effects. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

This suite of derived traits suggests major changes in energy expenditure and allocation in the human lineage, but direct measures of human and ape metabolism are needed to compare evolved energy strategies among hominoids. Here we used doubly labelled water measurements of total energy expenditure (TEE; kcal day−1) in humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans to test the hypothesis that the human lineage has experienced an acceleration in metabolic rate, providing energy for larger brains and faster reproduction without sacrificing maintenance and longevity. In multivariate regressions including body size and physical activity, human TEE exceeded that of chimpanzees and bonobos, gorillas and orangutans by approximately 400, 635 and 820 kcal day−1, respectively, readily accommodating the cost of humans' greater brain size and reproductive output. Much of the increase in TEE is attributable to humans' greater basal metabolic rate (kcal day−1), indicating increased organ metabolic activity. Humans also had the greatest body fat percentage. An increased metabolic rate, along with changes in energy allocation, was crucial in the evolution of human brain size and life history.},

abstract = {Life-history theory posits a fundamental trade-off between number and size of offspring that structures the variability in parental investment across and within species. We investigate this 'quantity-quality' trade-off across primates and present evidence that a similar trade-off is also found across natural-fertility human societies. Restating the classic Smith-Fretwell model in terms of allometric scaling of resource supply and offspring investment predicts an inverse scaling relation between birth rate and offspring size and a (-1/4) power scaling between birth rate and body size. We show that these theoretically predicted relationships, in particular the inverse scaling between number and size of offspring, tend to hold across increasingly finer scales of analyses (i.e. from mammals to primates to apes to humans). The advantage of this approach is that the quantity-quality trade-off in humans is placed into a general framework of parental investment that follows directly from first principles of energetic allocation.},

abstract = {When individuals in a population can acquire traits through learning, each individual may express a certain number of distinct cultural traits. These traits may have been either invented by the individual himself or acquired from others in the population. Here, we develop a game theoretic model for the accumulation of cultural traits through individual and social learning. We explore how the rates of innovation, decay, and transmission of cultural traits affect the evolutionary stable (ES) levels of individual and social learning and the number of cultural traits expressed by an individual when cultural dynamics are at a steady-state. We explore the evolution of these phenotypes in both panmictic and structured population settings. Our results suggest that in panmictic populations, the ES level of learning and number of traits tend to be independent of the social transmission rate of cultural traits and is mainly affected by the innovation and decay rates. By contrast, in structured populations, where interactions occur between relatives, the ES level of learning and the number of traits per individual can be increased (relative to the panmictic case) and may then markedly depend on the transmission rate of cultural traits. This suggests that kin selection may be one additional solution to Rogers's paradox of nonadaptive culture.},

abstract = {In this review we attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary history of hominin life history from extant and fossil evidence. We utilize demographic life history theory and distinguish life history variables, traits such as weaning, age at sexual maturity, and life span, from life history-related variables such as body mass, brain growth, and dental development. The latter are either linked with, or can be used to make inferences about, life history, thus providing an opportunity for estimating life history parameters in fossil taxa. We compare the life history variables of modern great apes and identify traits that are likely to be shared by the last common ancestor of Pan-Homo and those likely to be derived in hominins. All great apes exhibit slow life histories and we infer this to be true of the last common ancestor of Pan-Homo and the stem hominin. Modern human life histories are even slower, exhibiting distinctively long post-menopausal life spans and later ages at maturity, pointing to a reduction in adult mortality since the Pan-Homo split. We suggest that lower adult mortality, distinctively short interbirth intervals, and early weaning characteristic of modern humans are derived features resulting from cooperative breeding. We evaluate the fidelity of three life history-related variables, body mass, brain growth and dental development, with the life history parameters of living great apes. We found that body mass is the best predictor of great ape life history events. Brain growth trajectories and dental development and eruption are weakly related proxies and inferences from them should be made with caution. We evaluate the evidence of life history-related variables available for extinct species and find that prior to the transitional hominins there is no evidence of any hominin taxon possessing a body size, brain size or aspects of dental development much different from what we assume to be the primitive life history pattern for the Pan-Homo clade. Data for life history-related variables among the transitional hominin grade are consistent and none agrees with a modern human pattern. Aside from mean body mass, adult brain size, crown and root formation times, and the timing and sequence of dental eruption of Homo erectus are inconsistent with that of modern humans. Homo antecessor fossil material suggests a brain size similar to that of Homo erectus s. s., and crown formation times that are not yet modern, though there is some evidence of modern human-like timing of tooth formation and eruption. The body sizes, brain sizes, and dental development of Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis are consistent with a modern human life history but samples are too small to be certain that they have life histories within the modern human range. As more life history-related variable information for hominin species accumulates we are discovering that they can also have distinctive life histories that do not conform to any living model. At least one extinct hominin subclade, Paranthropus, has a pattern of dental life history-related variables that most likely set it apart from the life histories of both modern humans and chimpanzees.},

abstract = {A high level of encephalization is critical to the human adaptive niche and emerged among hominins over the course of the past 2 Myr. Evolving larger brains required important adaptive adjustments, in particular regarding energy allocation and life history. These adaptations included a relatively small brain at birth and a protracted growth of highly dependent offspring within a complex social environment. In turn, the extended period of growth and delayed maturation of the brain structures of humans contribute to their cognitive complexity. The current palaeoanthropological evidence shows that, regarding life history and brain ontogeny, the Pleistocene hominin taxa display different patterns and that one cannot simply contrast an 'ape-model' to a 'human-model'. Large-brained hominins such as Upper Pleistocene Neandertals have evolved along their own evolutionary pathway and can be distinguished from modern humans in terms of growth pattern and brain development. The life-history pattern and brain ontogeny of extant humans emerged only recently in the course of human evolution.},

abstract = {From an evolutionary perspective, the existence of senescence is a paradox. Why has senescence not been more effectively selected against given its associated decreases in Darwinian fitness? Why does senescence exist and how has it evolved? Three major theories offer explanations: (1) the theory of mutation accumulation suggested by PB Medawar; (2) the theory of antagonistic pleiotropy suggested by GC Williams; and (3) the disposable soma theory suggested by TBL Kirkwood. These three theories differ in the underlying causes of aging that they propose but are not mutually exclusive. This paper compares the specific biological predictions of each theory and discusses the methods and results of previous empirical tests. Lifespan is found to be the most frequently used estimate of senescence in evolutionary investigations. This measurement acts as a proxy for an individual's rate of senescence, but provides no information on an individual's senescent state or "biological age" throughout life. In the future, use of alternative longitudinal measures of senescence may facilitate investigation of previously neglected aspects of evolutionary models, such as intra- and inter-individual heterogeneity in the process of aging. DNA methylation data are newly proposed to measure biological aging and are suggested to be particularly useful for such investigations.},

abstract = {There have been many attempts to document links between reproductive allocation and factors such as adult body size and demography. This paper suggests that among closely related taxa, two dimensionless numbers, each a benefit–cost ratio summarizing reproductive timing, allocation and demography, are invariants and thus are useful to classify life histories. The two numbers are E/$\alpha$ and C{\textperiodcentered}E, where E is average adult life span, $\alpha$ is age-at-first-reproduction and C is average mass (per adult) devoted to reproduction per unit of time, divided by the average adult body mass (m); C is usually called ‘reproductive effort'. Since E−1 is the average adult mortality rate, C/E−1 is the reproductive effort (benefit) per unit death (cost). Similarly, E/$\alpha$ is the amount of time for reproduction (E) divided by the time cost to get there ($\alpha$). Combining these two numbers with the relative size (I) of an offspring (I/m) yields a new classification scheme for life histories; this is contrasted with other classification schemes (e.g. r and K).},

A trade-off between the size and number of flowers produced is an assumption of models of floral display evolution, but this trade-off is often not observed. We tested three hypotheses for why a trade-off between flower size and number is not observed, using 32 populations of Mimulus guttatus and 83 genera from the California flora. We found support for the hypothesis that high variance in resource acquisition masks a trade-off between flower size and number. In contrast, we did not find support for the hypothesis that trade-offs between current and future reproduction mask negative correlations between flower size and number in lineages with a perennial life history. We also did not find support for the hypothesis that negative flower size-number correlations are less likely to be observed in lineages with lower variation in flower number because the correlation between two variables is weaker when the range of values is narrower. Overall, our results support the life history evolution literature in suggesting that high variance in resource acquisition relative to allocation can often explain why traits that are predicted to trade off are instead positively correlated. {\textcopyright} 2012 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract = {Bet-hedging theory addresses how individuals should optimize fitness in varying and unpredictable environments by sacrificing mean fitness to decrease variation in fitness. So far, three main bet-hedging strategies have been described: conservative bet-hedging (play it safe), diversified bet-hedging (don't put all eggs in one basket) and adaptive coin flipping (choose a strategy at random from a fixed distribution). Within this context, we analyse the trade-off between many small eggs (or seeds) and few large, given an unpredictable environment. Our model is an extension of previous models and allows for any combination of the bet-hedging strategies mentioned above. In our individual-based model (accounting for both ecological and evolutionary forces), the optimal bet-hedging strategy is a combination of conservative and diversified bet-hedging and adaptive coin flipping, which means a variation in egg size both within clutches and between years. Hence, we show how phenotypic variation within a population, often assumed to be due to non-adaptive variation, instead can be the result of females having this mixed strategy. Our results provide a new perspective on bet-hedging and stress the importance of extreme events in life history evolution.},

Negative covariation between these strategies is theoretically expected, but empirical evidence is limited and inconsistent. Moreover, covariation may be affected by other life-history traits and may vary across levels of biological organization. We assessed dispersal (vertical fall time of fruits, a proxy for wind dispersal ability) and dormancy (germination fractions measured during germination trials) in populations of 15 annual and 12 perennial wind-dispersed species in six Asteraceae genera from South Africa. Dormancy was higher in annuals than in perennials, whereas fall time was largely determined by evolutionary history. Controlling for phylogeny, dispersal and dormancy was negatively associated across species and life-history categories. Negative covariation between dispersal and dormancy was not evident at either the individual level (except for seed heteromorphic species) or the population level. Our study provides rare empirical support for the theoretical expectation of tradeoffs between dormancy and the alternative risk-reducing strategies, perenniality and dispersal, but refutes the expectation of increased dispersability in perennials. Although negative covariation between dispersal and dormancy at the species level appears not to be a simple consequence of upscaling individual-level mechanistic tradeoffs, our findings suggest that selection for one strategy may constrain evolution of the other.},

Possibly the most studied life-history phenotypic relationship is the trade-off between parental effort and survival. However, evidence supporting this trade-off is equivocal. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to test the generality of this tenet. Using experimental studies that manipulated parental effort in birds, we show that (i) the effect of parental effort on survival was similar across species regardless of phylogeny; (ii) individuals that experienced reduced parental effort had similar survival probabilities than control individuals, regardless of sex; and (iii) males that experienced increased parental effort were less likely to survive than control males, whereas females that experienced increased effort were just as likely to survive as control females. Our results suggest that the trade-off between parental effort and survival is more complex than previously assumed. Finally, our study provides recommendations of unexplored avenues of future research into life-history trade-offs.},

Multistate capture-recapture models are used to incorporate the state-specific recapture probability and to investigate the influence of age and ecological conditions on the cost of reproduction, defined as the difference between survival of breeder and non-breeder ewes on a logistic scale. 2. The cost is identified as a quadratic function of age, being greatest for females breeding at 1 year of age and when more than 7 years old. Costs, however, were only present during severe environmental conditions (wet and stormy winters occurring when population density was high). 3. Winter severity and population size explain most of the variation in the probability of breeding for the first time at 1 year of life, but did not affect the subsequent breeding probability. 4. The presence of a cost of reproduction was confirmed by an experiment where a subset of females was prevented from breeding in their first year of life. 5. Our results suggest that breeding decisions are quality or condition dependent. We show that the interaction between age and time has a significant effect on variation around the phenotypic trade-off function: selection against weaker individuals born into cohorts that experience severe environmental conditions early in life can progressively eliminate low-quality phenotypes from these cohorts, generating population-level effects.},

We studied age-specific survival rates in the willow tit Parus montanus in northern Finland using 15 years of capture-recapture data obtained from birds during the breeding seasons 1986-2000. In addition, short- and long-term costs of reproduction were investigated by comparing survival probabilities of breeding and non-breeding individuals. 2. We did not find evidence supporting age-specific survival probabilities in males. However, in females there was a significant decline in survival after the age of 5 years. 3. Reproduction did not impair individuals' chances of being alive in the subsequent year (short-term cost) because breeding males and females had similar survival rates as non-breeders. 4. Demographic costs of breeding appeared later in life. Females skipping breeding earlier in life showed a higher probability of survival after the age of 5 years than females that bred every year until that age. This effect was non-significant in males. 5. The observed decline in survival probability late in life is likely to result from an increased cost of reproduction due to higher allocation of resources to breeding earlier in life, i.e. increased effort early in life is traded with survival late in life. The results also suggest that income breeders, such as small passerines, may pay long-term costs of reproduction. This is in agreement with the disposable soma theory of ageing.},

abstract = {Fitness costs of reproduction play a key role in understanding the evolution of reproductive tactics. Nevertheless, the detection and the intensity of costs of reproduction vary according to which life-history traits and species are studied. We propose an evolutionary model demonstrating that the chance of detecting a cost of reproduction should be lower when the fitness component studied has a low rather than high variance. Consequently, the fitness component that is affected the most by costs of reproduction should vary with life speed. Since long-lived species have developed a strategy that avoids jeopardizing their survival and short-lived species favour current reproduction, variance in survival is smaller and variance in reproduction higher in long-lived vs. short-lived species. We review empirical studies of costs of reproduction in free-ranging mammals, comparing evidence of costs reported among species and focal traits. In support of our model, more studies reported evidence of reproductive costs of reproduction in ungulates than in rodents, whereas survival costs of reproduction were more frequent in rodents than in ungulates. The life-history model we propose is expected to apply to any species, and hence provides a better understanding of life-history variation, which should be relevant to all evolutionary ecologists.},

abstract = {A central tenet of evolutionary biology states that life-history traits are linked via trade-offs, as classically exemplified by the van Noordwijk and de Jong model. This model, however, assumes that the relative resource allocation to a biological function varies independently of the total resource acquisition. Based on current empirical evidence, we first explored the dependency between the total resource acquisition and the relative resource allocation to reproduction and showed that such dependency is the rule rather than the exception. We then derived the expression of the covariance between traits when the assumption of independence is relaxed and used simulations to quantify the importance of such dependency on the detection of trade-offs between current reproduction and future survival. We found that the dependency between the total energy acquisition and the relative allocation to reproduction can influence the probability to detect trade-offs between survival and reproduction. As a general rule, a negative dependency between the total energy acquisition and the relative allocation to reproduction should lead to a higher probability of detecting a trade-off in species with a fast pace of life, whereas a positive dependency should lead to a higher probability of detecting a trade-off in species with a slow pace of life. In addition to confirming the importance of resource variation to reveal trade-offs, our finding demonstrates that the covariance between resource allocation and resource acquisition is generally not null and also plays a fundamental role in the detection of trade-offs.},

One line of evidence supporting this come from eliminating reproduction, for example, by surgically removing gonads. However, recent evidence from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that the apparent tradeoffs it shows might not be due to resource allocation at all but rather to the effects of a molecular signal originating in the germ line that represses longevity. These results should cause us to rethink the interpretation of many classic experiments in life history evolution.},

abstract = {Senescence is the post-maturation decline in survivorship and fecundity that accompanies advancing age. Two main evolutionary theories have been proposed to account for senescence. (1) The mutation-accumulation theory. Deleterious mutations exerting their effects only late in life would tend to accumulate, because of their minimal effects on fitness. More precisely, exclusively late-acting deleterious mutations will attain higher equilibrium frequencies under mutation-selection balance than will mutations that act early, resulting in lower mean values for fitness components late in life (ref. 3, p. 218). Medawar emphasized the possibility that this effect would be enhanced by selection of modifiers that postpone the age of onset of genetic diseases. (2) The pleiotropy theory. Williams suggested that many of the genes with beneficial effects on early fitness components have pleiotropy deleterious effects on late fitness components, but are nevertheless favoured by natural selection. (These theories are based on the decline with age in the effect of age-specific fitness-component changes on total fitness (ref. 3, pp. 206-214 and refs 4, 5). Either or both of these theories could apply in any particular population.) Selection experiments in Drosophila and Tribolium support the pleiotropy theory, although one such experiment gave results that only bordered on significance, but the mutation-accumulation theory has never been tested. The present results provide evidence for the pleiotropy theory, but do not support the mutation-accumulation theory. Reproduced by permission.

@article{Abrams1995,
abstract = {The ''disposable soma'' theory for the evolution of senescence suggests that senescence arises from an optimal balancing of resources between reproduction and somatic repair. Dynamic programming models are constructed and analyzed to determine the optimal relationship between reproduction, diversion of resources from repair, and added senescent mortality. Of particular interest is the relationship between the repair-reproduction trade-off and the form of the mortality-rate-versus-age curve predicted. The models analyzed in the greatest detail assume that the relationship between reproduction and added senescent mortality does not change with age. These suggest that mortality should increase at an increasing rate with age, but may approach a linear rate as mortality becomes very high. General results are derived for the shape of the mortality curves early and late in the senescing part of the life span, and mortality curves for specific trade-off functions are illustrated. An exponential increase in death rate with age (Gompertz' Law) corresponds to only one of many possible relationships between reproduction and aging. The ''Law'' is unlikely to hold generally if the disposable soma theory accounts for a large fraction of the observed senescent increase in mortality with age. However, support for the generality of Gompertz' Law is weak, and other theories have not produced an evolutionary explanation for the law. The disposable soma theory is consistent with some of the exceptions to Gompertz' Law that have been observed.},

abstract = {While the wealth of projection matrices in plant demography permits comparative studies, variation in matrix dimensions complicates interspecific comparisons. Collapsing matrices to a common dimension may facilitate such comparisons but may also bias the inferred demographic parameters. Here we examine how matrix dimension affects inferred demographic elasticities and how different collapsing criteria perform. We analyzed 13 x 13 matrices representing nine plant species, collapsing these matrices (i) into even 7 x 7, 5 x 5, 4 x 4, and 3 x 3 matrices and (ii) into 5 x 5 matrices using different criteria. Stasis and fecundity elasticities increased when matrix dimension was reduced, whereas those of progression and retrogression decreased. We suggest a collapsing criterion that minimizes dissimilarities between the original- and collapsed-matrix elasticities and apply it to 66 plant species to study how life span and growth form influence the relationship between matrix dimension and elasticities. Our analysis demonstrates that (i) projection matrix dimension has significant effects on inferred demographic parameters, (ii) there are better-performing methods than previously suggested for standardizing matrix dimension, and (iii) herbaceous perennial projection matrices are particularly sensitive to changes in matrix dimensionality. For comparative demographic studies, we recommend normalizing matrices to a common dimension by collapsing higher classes and leaving the first few classes unaltered.},

By this hypothesis, evolutionary conflict between males and females, mothers and foetuses, hosts and parasites, and other parties with divergent fitness interests has led to rapid evolution of genetic systems involved in control over fertilization and cellular resources. The genes involved in such systems promote cancer risk as a secondary effect of their roles in antagonistic coevolution, which generates evolutionary disequilibrium and maladaptation. Evidence from two sources: (1) studies on specific genes, including SPANX cancer/testis antigen genes, several Y-linked genes, the pem homebox gene, centromeric histone genes, the breast cancer gene BRCA1, the angiogenesis gene ANG, cadherin genes, cytochrome P450 genes, and viral oncogenes; and (2) large-scale database studies of selection on different functional categories of genes, supports our hypothesis.

We argue that they are only appropriate when intervals between reproductive events are fixed, as they are dimensionless generation-to-generation scalings with units offspring per parent. A fitness measure should account for two different effects of a decrease in generation time: (1) increased survival due to shorter exposure to mortality agents and (2) increased frequency of reproduction. R(o) and RV deal with the first of these two effects, while a measure with a physical dimension per time [T-1] is needed to account for the second. The Malthusian growth parameter, r, meets this requirement and in situations where time to reproduction is variable, we propose rho, the instantaneous rate of spread of descendants (from an individual) be used instead of R(o). As an alternative to RV, we suggest using the instantaneous difference PHI = rho - r, where r is the population rate of increase. While RV and R(o) are dimensionless ratios, PHI, and rho are per time rates which are appropriate in accounting for alterations in generation time.},

We chose 160 women for BRCA1 analysis: 103 with a family history of breast cancer and 57 with a family history of breast-ovarian cancer. To detect small mutations, we generated and analyzed 35 overlapping genomic PCR products that cover the coding portion of the gene, by using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Thirty-eight truncating mutations (32 frameshifts, 4 nonsense mutations, and 2 splice variants) were observed in 15{\%} of women with a family history of breast cancer only and in 40{\%} of those with a history of breast-ovarian cancer. Twelve of 25 distinct truncating mutations identified were novel and unique. Most BRCA1 mutations that had been reported more than five times in the Breast Cancer Information Core were present in our series. One mutation (5149del4) observed in two apparently unrelated families most likely originates from a common ancestor. The position of truncating mutations did not significantly affect the ratio of the risk of breast cancer to that of ovarian cancer. In addition, 15 DNA variants (14 missense mutations and 1 neutral mutation) were identified, 9 of which were novel. Indirect evidence suggests that seven of these mutations are deleterious.},

abstract = {Matrix projection models are a central tool in many areas of population biology. In most applications, one starts from the projection matrix to quantify the asymptotic growth rate of the population (the dominant eigenvalue), the stable stage distribution, and the reproductive values (the dominant right and left eigenvectors, respectively). Any primitive projection matrix also has an associated ergodic Markov chain that contains information about the genealogy of the population. In this paper, we show that these facts can be used to specify any matrix population model as a triple consisting of the ergodic Markov matrix, the dominant eigenvalue and one of the corresponding eigenvectors. This decomposition of the projection matrix separates properties associated with lineages from those associated with individuals. It also clarifies the relationships between many quantities commonly used to describe such models, including the relationship between eigenvalue sensitivities and elasticities. We illustrate the utility of such a decomposition by introducing a new method for aggregating classes in a matrix population model to produce a simpler model with a smaller number of classes. Unlike the standard method, our method has the advantage of preserving reproductive values and elasticities. It also has conceptually satisfying properties such as commuting with changes of units.},

However, it is complex and hard to interpret. Here, we present a new approach where the generation time is envisioned as a return time in an appropriate Markov chain. This yields surprisingly simple results, such as the fact that the generation time is the inverse of the sum of the elasticities of the growth rate to changes in the fertilities. This result sheds new light on the interpretation of elasticities (which as we show correspond to the frequency of events in the ancestral lineage of the population), and we use it to generalize a result known as Lebreton's formula. Finally, we also show that the generation time can be seen as a random variable, and we give a general expression for its distribution.},

@article{Levitis2013,
abstract = {There persist two widely held but mutually inconsistent views on the evolution of post-fertile lifespan of human females. The first, prevalent within anthropology, sees post-fertile lifespan (PFLS) in the light of adaptive processes, focusing on the social and economic habits of humans that selected for a lengthy PFLS. This view rests on the assumption that human PFLS is distinct from that of other species, and focuses on quantifying the selective causes and consequences of that difference. The second view, prevalent within gerontology and comparative biology, emphasizes that PFLS is a phylogenetically widespread trait or that human PFLS is predictable based on life-history allometries. In this view, human PFLS is part of a broad cross-species pattern and its genesis cannot, therefore, rely on human-specific traits. Those who advocate the second view have questioned the "special pleading" for human specific explanations of PFLS, and have argued that human PFLS is quantitatively greater but not qualitatively different than PFLS in many other animals. Papers asking whether human PFLS is explained by the importance of mothers more than grandmothers, whether paternal or maternal grandparents have more of an effect on child survival, or who is providing the excess calories are associated with the first view that assumes the need to explain the existence of human PFLS on the basis of a uniquely human socioecology. Anthropologists largely see human PFLS as derived, while comparative gerontologists point to evidence that it is one instance of a ubiquitous cross-species pattern. The two groups generally occupy non-overlapping research circles, in terms of conferences and journals, and therefore interact little enough to largely avoid the need to reconcile their views, allowing the persistence of misconceptions in each field. Our goal is to identify and address the most important of these misconceptions and thereby make clear that both of these seemingly incongruent views contain valid points. We argue that two distinct but related traits have been lumped together under the same concept of "post-reproductive lifespan," one (post-fertile viability) that is tremendously widespread and another (a post-fertile life stage) that is derived to hominins, and that the differences and connections between these two traits are necessary for understanding human life-history evolution.},

abstract = {The recent demographic transitions to lower mortality and fertility rates in most human societies have led to changes and even quick reversals in phenotypic selection pressures. This can only result in evolutionary change if the affected traits are heritable, but changes in environmental conditions may also lead to subsequent changes in the genetic variance and covariance (the G matrix) of traits. It currently remains unclear if there have been concomitant changes in the G matrix of life history traits following the demographic transition. Using 300 years of genealogical data from Finland, we found that four key life history traits were heritable both before and after the demographic transition. The estimated heritabilities allow a quantifiable genetic response to selection during both time periods, thus facilitating continued evolutionary change. Further, the G matrices remained largely stable but revealed a trend for an increased additive genetic variance and thus evolutionary potential of the population after the transition. Our results demonstrate the validity of predictions of evolutionary change in human populations even after the recent dramatic environmental change, and facilitate predictions of how our biology interacts with changing environments, with implications for global public health and demography.

abstract = {Powerful multiple regression-based approaches are commonly used to measure the strength of phenotypic selection, which is the statistical association between individual fitness and trait values. Age structure and overlapping generations complicate determinations of individual fitness, contributing to the popularity of alternative methods for measuring natural selection that do not depend upon such measures. The application of regression-based techniques for measuring selection in these situations requires a demographically appropriate, conceptually sound, and observable measure of individual fitness. It has been suggested that Fisher's reproductive value applied to an individual at its birth is such a definition. Here I offer support for this assertion by showing that multiple regression applied to this measure and vital rates (age-specific survival and fertility rates) yields the same selection gradients for vital rates as those inferred from Hamilton's classical results. I discuss how multiple regressions, applied to individual reproductive value at birth, can be used efficiently to estimate measures of phenotypic selection that are problematic for sensitivity analyses. These include nonlinear selection, components of the opportunity for selection, and multilevel selection.},

Therefore, comparisons of such variance across studies and taxa will only be valid if the life cycles employed are complete (i.e., an entire generation), precisely defined (e.g., egg to egg or adult to adult), and identical. Given a well-defined life cycle, we present methods for obtaining estimates of the variance of lifetime reproductive success among individuals using demographic data. The estimates are based on the assumptions of no selection and negligible covariance between life span and reproductive effort. The techniques can be used to investigate the effects of alternate life histories on the distribution of reproductive success in a population, as well as to obtain estimates of effective population size. They may also provide a null model for investigations of selection. Some theoretical and empirical results are presented. A method for obtaining confidence intervals for the estimates is described.},

abstract = {Human life histories combine late age at first reproduction, long reproductive span, relatively high fertility, and substantial postreproductive survival. However, even among the most fecund populations, human fertility falls far below its theoretical maximum. The extent of parental care required for successful offspring recruitment and widespread fertility decline under proper economic conditions suggest that selection on fertility is constrained by trade-offs with recruitment. Here we measure the trade-offs between life history traits under selection by approximating the slope of the selective constraint curve on two traits at the observed values. Using a selection of populations that span human demographic space, we find that the substitution elasticity of fertility for infant survival shows age-related patterns, with minimum substitution elasticities ranging from 14 to 22 for the four populations. The age of this minimum occurs earlier in the high-mortality populations relative to generation time than it does in the low-mortality populations. The human curves are qualitatively similar to one of two comparable nonhuman primate age-specific substitution elasticity curves. The curve for rhesus macaques has a similar shape but is shifted down, meaning that the threshold for switching from investing in survival to fertility is lower at all ages. The magnitude of the substitution elasticities is similar between chimpanzees and humans but the shape is quite different, rising more slowly for a longer fraction of the chimpanzee life cycle. The steeply rising substitution elasticities with age in humans has clear implications for the evolution of reproductive senescence.},

Available modelling methods are diverse, but analysis usually focuses on long-term dynamics that are unable to describe the complicated short-term time series that can arise even from simple models following ecological disturbances or perturbations. Recent interest in such transient dynamics has led to diverse methodologies for their quantification in density-independent, time-invariant population projection matrix (PPM) models, but the fragmented nature of this literature has stifled the widespread analysis of transients. We review the literature on transient analyses of linear PPM models and synthesise a coherent framework. We promote the use of standardised indices, and categorise indices according to their focus on either convergence times or transient population density, and on either transient bounds or case-specific transient dynamics. We use a large database of empirical PPM models to explore relationships between indices of transient dynamics. This analysis promotes the use of population inertia as a simple, versatile and informative predictor of transient population density, but criticises the utility of established indices of convergence times. Our findings should guide further development of analyses of transient population dynamics using PPMs or other empirical modelling techniques.},

Nevertheless, empirical studies often find that certain structural features of the matrix are remarkably constant, suggesting that persistent selection regimes or other factors promote stability. On the theoretical side, no one has been able to derive equations that would relate stability of the G-matrix to selection regimes, population size, migration, or to the details of genetic architecture.

abstract = {Matrix population models in which individuals are classified by both age and stage can be constructed using the vec-permutation matrix. The resulting age-stage models can be used to derive the age-specific consequences of a stage-specific life history or to describe populations in which the vital rates respond to both age and stage. I derive a general formula for the sensitivity of any output (scalar, vector, or matrix-valued) of the model, to any vector of parameters, using matrix calculus. The matrices describing age-stage dynamics are almost always reducible; I present results giving conditions under which population growth is ergodic from any initial condition. As an example, I analyze a published stage-specific model of Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius), an invasive perennial shrub. Sensitivity analysis of the population growth rate finds that the selection gradients on adult survival do not always decrease with age but may increase over a range of ages. This may have implications for the evolution of senescence in stage-classified populations. I also derive and analyze the joint distribution of age and stage at death and present a sensitivity analysis of this distribution and of the marginal distribution of age at death.},

abstract = {It has been shown that differences in fecundity variance can influence the probability of invasion of a genotype in a population; i.e., a genotype with lower variance in offspring number can be favored in finite populations even if it has a somewhat lower mean fitness than a competitor. In this article, Gillespie's results are extended to population genetic systems with explicit age structure, where the demographic variance (variance in growth rate) calculated in the work of Engen and colleagues is used as a generalization of "variance in offspring number" to predict the interaction between deterministic and random forces driving change in allele frequency. By calculating the variance from the life-history parameters, it is shown that selection against variance in the growth rate will favor a genotypes with lower stochasticity in age-specific survival and fertility rates. A diffusion approximation for selection and drift in a population with two genotypes with different life-history matrices (and therefore different mean growth rates and demographic variances) is derived and shown to be consistent with individual-based simulations. It is also argued that for finite populations, perturbation analyses of both the mean and the variance in growth rate may be necessary to determine the sensitivity of fitness to changes in the life-history parameters.},

We obtain the invadability condition of a mutant-type into the wild-type population at the equilibrium state. The condition depends on the left and right eigenvectors at the equilibrium state. The condition depends on the left and right eigenvectors at the equilibrium state and the difference, between wild-type and mutant-type populations, of the values of elements in the Lefkovitch matrix at the equilibrium state. It is also shown that if elements of the density-dependent Lefkovitch matrix are decreasing functions of population density, then the equilibrium population density increases in the process of natural selection; that is, K-selection acts even on the stage-structured population. The evolution of life history in perennial plants is discussed through two models as an application of the above results. The evolution of perennial plants with no vegetative reproduction is analyzed in the first example. It is shown that whether monocarpic perennials (which reproduce once and die) or polycarpic perennial plants (which reproduce more than once) are favored depends on the cost of a produced seed. The second example concerns perennial plants that reproduce vegetatively. It is shown that whether monocarpic or polycarpic perennial plants are favored depends on the cost of a seed and that where vegetative reproduction is common, polycarpic perennials with no seed reproduction are favored.},

abstract = {How should fitness be measured to determine which phenotype or "strategy" is uninvadable when evolution occurs in subdivided populations subject to local demographic and environmental heterogeneity? Several invasion fitness measures, such as basic reproductive number, lifetime dispersal success of a local lineage, or inclusive fitness have been proposed to address this question, but the relationships between them and their generality remains unclear. Here, we ascertain uninvadability (all mutant strategies always go extinct) in terms of the growth rate of a mutant allele arising as a single copy in a population. We show from this growth rate that uninvadability is equivalently characterized by at least three conceptually distinct invasion fitness measures: (i) lineage fitness, giving the average personal fitness of a randomly sampled mutant lineage member; (ii) inclusive fitness, giving a reproductive value weighted average of the direct fitness cost and relatedness weighted indirect fitness benefits accruing to a randomly sampled mutant lineage member; and (iii) three types of reproductive numbers, giving lifetime success of a local lineage. Our analysis connects approaches that have been deemed different, generalizes the exact version of inclusive fitness to class-structured populations, and provides a biological interpretation of selection on a mutant allele under arbitrary strength of selection.},

We partition the opportunity for selection into multiplicative episodes using the techniques of Arnold and Wade (1984a. 1984b) and measure selection on several morphological and behavioral characters. For both sexes, variance in survivorship was the largest contribution to variance in lifetime reproductive success. Covariance effects for selection calculated on a daily gesting considerable non-independence of episodes. Opportunity for selection calculated on a daily basis did not approximate analogous values determined from lifetime reproductive success. Phenotypic characters for which we investigated selection included body mass, hind wing length, first date of reproduction, and (for males) an index of territorial aggressiveness. We failed to find any significant direct targets of selection in either males or females. However, the combined effects of direct and indirect selection on early reproduction were significant for males, acting primarily through increased survivorship and increased time per day spent at the pond. Similarly, females present earlier in the season had shorter interclutch intervals. Partitioning of selection acting on male hind wing length and on aggressiveness reveals relationships between selective episodes, possibly indicative of phenotypic trade-offs between natural and sexual selection through male-male competition for females. Division of selection into episodes is a useful technique for identifying the source of selection. However, ordering effects can bias results, except when episodes occur in strictly chronological sequence. We present a method for circumventing this difficulty},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to quantify the effect of risk factors for childhood mortality in a typical rural setting in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We performed a survival analysis of births within a population under demographic surveillance from 1992 to 1999 based on data from a demographic surveillance system in 39 villages around Nouna, western Burkina Faso, with a total population of about 30000. All children born alive in the period 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1999 in the study area (n = 10 122) followed-up until 31 December 1999 were included. All-cause childhood mortality was used as outcome variable. FINDINGS: Within the observation time, 1340 deaths were recorded. In a Cox regression model a simultaneous estimation of hazard rate ratios showed death of the mother and being a twin as the strongest risk factors for mortality. For both, the risk was most pronounced in infancy. Further factors associated with mortality include age of the mother, birth spacing, season of birth, village, ethnic group, and distance to the nearest health centre. Finally, there was an overall decrease in childhood mortality over the years 1993-99. CONCLUSION: The study supports the multi-causation of childhood deaths in rural West Africa during the 1990s and supports the overall trend, as observed in other studies, of decreasing childhood mortality in these populations. The observed correlation between the factors highlights the need for multivariate analysis to disentangle the separate effects. These findings illustrate the need for more comprehensive improvement of prenatal and postnatal care in rural sub-Saharan Africa.},

Here we derive a new method for calculating the timing of reproductive output, from which the generation time and its variance can also be calculated. The method is based on the explicit computation of the net reproductive rate (R0) using a new graphical approach. Using nodding thistle, desert tortoise, creeping aven, and cat's ear as examples, we show how R0 and the timing of reproduction is calculated and interpreted, even in cases with complex life cycles. We show that the explicit R0 formula allows us to explore the effect of all reproductive pathways in the life cycle, something that cannot be done with traditional analysis of the population growth rate (lambda). Additionally, we compare a recently published method for determining population persistence conditions with the condition R0 {\textgreater} 1 and show how the latter is simpler and more easily interpreted biologically. Using our calculation of the timing of reproductive output, we illustrate how this demographic measure can be used to understand the effects of life-history traits on population growth and control.},

@article{Steidinger2014,
abstract = {Abstract Evolutionary theory predicts that mutualisms based on the reciprocal exchange of costly services should be susceptible to exploitation by cheaters. Consistent with theory, both cheating and discrimination against cheaters are ubiquitous features of mutualisms. Several recent studies have confirmed that host species differ in the extent that they are able to discriminate against cheaters, suggesting that cheating may be stabilized by the existence of susceptible hosts (dubbed "givers"). We use an evolutionary game-theoretical approach to demonstrate how discriminating and giver hosts associating with mutualist and cheater partners can coexist. Discriminators drive the proportion of cheaters below a critical threshold, at which point there is no benefit to investing resources into discrimination. This promotes givers, who benefit from mutualists but allow cheater populations to rebound. We then apply this model to the plant-mycorrhizal mutualism and demonstrate it is one mechanism for generating host-specific responses to mycorrhizal fungal species necessary to generate negative plant-soil feedbacks. Our model makes several falsifiable, qualitative predictions for plant-mycorrhizal population dynamics across gradients of soil phosphorus availability and interhost differences in ability to discriminate. Finally, we suggest applications and limitations of the model with regard to coexistence in specific biological systems.},

abstract = {The physiology of reproductive senescence in women is well understood, but the drivers of variation in senescence rates are less so. Evolutionary theory predicts that early-life investment in reproduction should be favoured by selection at the cost of reduced survival and faster reproductive senescence. We tested this hypothesis using data collected from preindustrial Finnish church records. Reproductive success increased up to age 25 and was relatively stable until a decline from age 41. Women with higher early-life fecundity (ELF; producing more children before age 25) subsequently had higher mortality risk, but high ELF was not associated with accelerated senescence in annual breeding success. However, women with higher ELF experienced faster senescence in offspring survival. Despite these apparent costs, ELF was under positive selection: individuals with higher ELF had higher lifetime reproductive success. These results are consistent with previous observations in both humans and wild vertebrates that more births and earlier onset of reproduction are associated with reduced survival, and with evolutionary theory predicting trade-offs between early reproduction and later-life survival. The results are particularly significant given recent increases in maternal ages in many societies and the potential consequences for offspring health and fitness.},

abstract = {Based on data from radio-collared individuals, we present an analysis of the viability of two small populations of the Scandinavian brown bear, Ursus arctos. The northern and southern populations had different demographic characteristics, even though the population growth rate r and the demographic variance s(d)/2 were high in both populations (r = 0.13 and s(d)/2 = 0.180 in the north, and r = 0.15 and s(d)/2 = 0.155 in the south). In the northern population the environmental variance s(e)/2 was not significantly different from 0, whereas in the south s(e)/2 = 0.003. In the south, this was related to high environmental stochasticity in the survival rate of the youngest animals, which resulted in an increase in survival with age in this population. In contrast, in the north, the probability of survival showed a slight decrease with age. Uncertainties were obtained from the joint distribution of bootstrap replications of r, s(d)/2 and s(e)/2. Although the uncertainty in these estimates is quite large, it is unlikely that even relatively small populations 10 females 1 year old) will decline to size less than 1 after 100 years. Analysis of the distribution of the critical population size (i.e. the population size where the population's logarithmic growth rate is zero) shows that these brown bear populations must be larger than 3-4 females 1 year or older to secure a positive growth rate. Similarly, if we define a viable population as the population size where the chance of survival is greater than 90{\%} during a period of 100 years, 8 females 1 year old must be present in the north and 6 females in the south. This high viability of even small brown bear populations is due to high reproductive and survival rates. A relatively small increase in the mortality rate will strongly reduce the viability of even relatively large brown bear populations.},

Mortality plateaus result from multiplicative (proportional) and additive hazards, but not from accelerated failure time models. Frailty can have any distribution with regularly-varying-at-0 density and the distribution of frailty among survivors to each subsequent age converges to a gamma distribution. In a multiplicative setting the baseline cumulative hazard can be represented as the inverse of the negative logarithm of any completely monotone function.

Here, we consider how life history may affect the rate of evolution via its influence on the fixation probability of slightly beneficial mutations. Our approach is based on diffusion modeling for a finite, stage-structured population with stochastic population dynamics. The results, which are verified by computer simulations, demonstrate that even with complex population structure just two demographic parameters are sufficient to give an accurate approximation of the fixation probability of a slightly beneficial mutation. These are the reproductive value of the stage in which the mutation first occurs and the demographic variance of the population. The demographic variance also determines what influence population size has on the fixation probability. This model represents a substantial generalization of earlier models, covering a large range of life histories.},

The applicability of these parameters are investigated by checking how an age-structured population process can be approximated by a diffusion with only three parameters. These are the deterministic growth rate computed from the expected projection matrix and the environmental and demographic variances. We also consider age-structured populations where the fecundity at any stage is either zero or one, and there is neither environmental stochasticity nor dependence between individual fecundity and survival. In this case the demographic variance is uniquely determined by the vital rates defining the projection matrix. The demographic variance for a long-lived bird species, the wandering albatross in the southwestern part of the Indian Ocean, is estimated. We also compute estimates of the age-specific contributions to the total demographic variance from survival, fecundity and the covariance between survival and fecundity. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In a series of seminal articles in 1974, 1975, and 1977, J. H. Gillespie challenged the notion that the "fittest" individuals are those that produce on average the highest number of offspring. He showed that in small populations, the variance in fecundity can determine fitness as much as mean fecundity. One likely reason why Gillespie's concept of within-generation bet hedging has been largely ignored is the general consensus that natural populations are of large size. As a consequence, essentially no work has investigated the role of the fecundity variance on the evolutionary stable state of life-history strategies. While typically large, natural populations also tend to be subdivided in local demes connected by migration. Here, we integrate Gillespie's measure of selection for within-generation bet hedging into the inclusive fitness and game theoretic measure of selection for structured populations. The resulting framework demonstrates that selection against high variance in offspring number is a potent force in large, but structured populations. More generally, the results highlight that variance in offspring number will directly affect various life-history strategies, especially those involving kin interaction. The selective pressures on three key traits are directly investigated here, namely within-generation bet hedging, helping behaviors, and the evolutionary stable dispersal rate. The evolutionary dynamics of all three traits are markedly affected by variance in offspring number, although to a different extent and under different demographic conditions.},

abstract = {We derive the frequency-dependent selection coefficient caused by "demographic" stochasticity resulting from the random sampling of opponents an individual faces during behavioral "contests" with other individuals. The mean, variance, and higher moments of fitness all influence the direction and strength of selection. A frequency-dependent trait can be stable when an individual's fitness depends upon an infinite number of contests with other individuals and unstable when it depends upon a finite number of contests. Conversely, unstable equilibria for an infinite number of contests can be stable when there is a finite number of contests. At stable equilibria for a finite number of contests, higher moments of fitness can outweigh the joint influence of the first two moments so that natural selection favors "within-generation" or developmental-trait variation (also known as phenotypic plasticity) contrary to the claim that natural selection always acts against such variation. We use second-moment estimates of the fitness functions in a diffusion approximation to compute fixation probabilities of competing strategies. These estimates are shown to be qualitatively consistent with those derived from simulations when population sizes are sufficiently large to ignore the contribution of higher-moment terms. We also show that explicit solutions to the diffusion approximation only exist for pair-wise interactions that lead to positive frequency-dependent selection. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

All parameters required to describe the population dynamics are simple properties of the distribution of these individual demographic contributions, which we call individual reproductive value. The asymptotic population growth rate in the average environment and the demographic and environmental variances are respectively the mean individual reproductive value over individuals through time and the variance within and between years. Our approach leads to an intuitive understanding of demographic and environmental variances in age-structured populations and their decomposition into additive age-specific components due to survival and reproduction. We show how to apply this approach to estimate the demographic and environmental variances and their components. The estimates are based on yearly random samples of individual vital rates and require no information about the total population size.},

First, if the variation in offspring number primarily occurs within generations, the strength of this selective force is inversely proportional to population size. Second, if this variation primarily occurs between generations, the strength of this selective force is proportional to the variance and independent of population size. These principles lie at the core of bet-hedging theory. Using the common currency of fixation probabilities, I derive a general principle for which within-generation correlation of individual fitness acts as a dial between Gillespie{\&}{\#}x2019;s limiting cases. At low correlations, within-generation variation is the primary selective force. At high correlations, between-generation variation is the dominant selective force. As corollary of this general principle, selection for diversified bet-hedging strategies is shown to require higher within-generation environmental correlations in smaller populations.},

abstract = {It was shown by Gillespie [1974. Am. Nat. 108, 145-151], that if two genotypes produce the same average number of offspring on but have a different variance associated within each generation, the genotype with a lower variance will have a higher effective fitness. Specifically, the effective fitness is we=w-$\sigma$2/N, where w is the mean fitness, $\sigma$2 is the variance in offspring number, and N is the total population size. The model also predicts that if a strategy has a higher arithmetic mean fitness and a higher variance than the competitor, the outcome of selection will depend on the population size (with larger population sizes favoring the high-variance, high-mean genotype). This suggests that for metapopulations with large numbers of (relatively) small demes, a strategy with lower variance and lower mean may be favored if the migration rate is low while higher migration rates (consistent with a larger effective population size) favor the opposite strategy. Individual-based simulation confirms that this is indeed the case for an island model of migration, though the effect of migration differs greatly depending on whether migration precedes or follows selection. It is noted in the appendix that while Gillespie [1974. Am. Nat. 108, 145-151] does seem to be heuristically accurate, it is not clear that the definition of effective fitness follows from his derivation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract = {Life-history theory predicts vital rates that on average make large contributions to the annual multiplication rate of a lineage should be highly buffered against environmental variability. This prediction has been tested by looking for a negative correlation between the sensitivities (or elasticities) of the elements in a projection matrix and their variances (or coefficients of variation). Here, we show by constructing random matrices that a spurious negative correlation exists between the sensitivities and variances, and between the elasticities and coefficients of variation, of matrix elements. This spurious correlation arises in part because size transition probabilities, which are bounded by 0 and 1, have a limit to their variability that often does not apply to matrix elements representing reproduction. We advocate an alternative analysis based on the underlying vital rates (not the matrix elements) that accounts for the inherent limit to the variability of zero-to-one vital rates, corrects for sampling variation, and tests for a declining upper limit to variability as a vital rate's fitness contribution increases. Applying this analysis to demographic data from five populations of the alpine cushion plant Silene acaulis, we provide evidence of stronger buffering in the vital rates that most influence fitness.},

However, the potential impact of changing climatic variability on the fate of populations has been largely unexamined. We analyzed multiyear demographic data for 36 plant and animal species with a broad range of life histories and types of environment to ask how sensitive their long-term stochastic population growth rates are likely to be to changes in the means and standard deviations of vital rates (survival, reproduction, growth) in response to changing climate. We quantified responsiveness using elasticities of the long-term population growth rate predicted by stochastic projection matrix models. Short-lived species (insects and annual plants and algae) are predicted to be more strongly (and negatively) affected by increasing vital rate variability relative to longer-lived species (perennial plants, birds, ungulates). Taxonomic affiliation has little power to explain sensitivity to increasing variability once longevity has been taken into account. Our results highlight the potential vulnerability of short-lived species to an increasingly variable climate, but also suggest that problems associated with short-lived undesirable species (agricultural pests, disease vectors, invasive weedy plants) may be exacerbated in regions where climate variability decreases},

abstract = {Darwinian fitness describes the capacity of an organism to appropriate resources from the environment and to convert these resources into net-offspring production. Studies of competition between related types indicate that fitness is analytically described by evolutionary entropy, a statistical measure which is positively correlated with population stability, and describes the number of accessible pathways of energy flow between the individuals in the population. Directionality theory is a mathematical model of the evolutionary process based on the concept evolutionary entropy as the measure of fitness. The theory predicts that the changes which occur as a population evolves from one non-equilibrium steady state to another are described by the following directionality principle–the fundamental theorem of evolution: (a) an increase in evolutionary entropy when resource composition is diverse, and resource abundance constant; (b) a decrease in evolutionary entropy when resource composition is singular, and resource abundance variable. Evolutionary entropy characterizes the dynamics of energy flow between the individual elements in various classes of biological networks: (a) demographic, where the units are individuals parameterized by age, and their age-specific fecundity and mortality; (b) metabolic, where the units are metabolites, and the transitions are the biochemical reactions that convert substrates to products; (c) social, where the units are social groups, and the forces are the cooperative and competitive interactions between the individual groups. This article reviews the analytical basis of the evolutionary entropic principle, and describes applications of directionality theory to the study of evolutionary dynamics in two biological systems; (i) social networks–the evolution of cooperation; (ii) metabolic networks–the evolution of body size.

abstract = {Competition between individuals for resources which are limited and diverse in composition is the ultimate driving force of evolution. Classical studies of this event contend that the outcome is a deterministic process predicted by the growth rate of the competing types-a tenet called the Malthusian selection principle. Recent studies of competition indicate that the dynamics of selection is a stochastic process, regulated by the population size, the abundance and diversity of the resource, and predicted by evolutionary entropy-a statistical parameter which characterizes the rate at which the population returns to the steady state condition after a random endogenous or exogenous perturbation. This tenet, which we will call the entropic selection principle entails the following relations: (a)When resources are constant, limited and diverse, variants with higher entropy will have a selective advantage and increase in frequency.(b)When resources undergo large variations in abundance and are singular, variants with lower entropy will have a selective advantage and increase in frequency. This article delineates the analytic, computational and empirical support for this tenet. We show moreover that the Malthusian selection principle, a cornerstone of classical evolutionary genetics, is the limit, as population size and resource abundance tends to infinity of the entropic selection principle. The Malthusian tenet is an approximation to the entropic selection principle-an approximation whose validity increases with increasing population size and increasing resource abundance. Evolutionary entropy is a generic concept that characterizes the interaction dynamics of metabolic entities at several levels of biological organization: cellular, organismic and ecological. Accordingly, the entropic selection principle represents a general rule for explaining the processes of adaptation and evolution at each of these levels. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We develop a model for somatic growth in fishes that explicitly allows for the energy demand imposed by reproduction. We show that the von Bertalanffy (VB) equation provides a good description of somatic growth after maturity, but not before. We show that the parameters of the VB equation are simple functions of age at maturity and reproductive investment. We use this model to show how the energy demands for both growth and reproduction trade off to determine optimal life-history traits. Assuming that both age at maturity and reproductive investment adapt to variations in adult mortality to maximize lifetime offspring production, our model predicts that: (i) the optimal age of maturity is inversely related to adult mortality rate; (ii) the optimal reproductive effort is approximately equal to adult mortality rate. These predictions are consistent with observed variations in the life-history traits of a large sample of iteroparous freshwater fishes.},

abstract = {In density-independent models, the population growth rate ?? measures population performance, and the perturbation analysis of ?? (its sensitivity and elasticity) plays an important role in demography. In density-dependent models, the invasion exponent log??I replaces ?? as a measure of population performance. The perturbation analysis of ??I reveals the effects of environmental changes and management actions, gives the direction and intensity of density-dependent natural selection on life history traits, and permits calculation of the sampling variance of the invasion exponent. Because density-dependent models require more data than density-independent models, it is tempting to look for substitutes for the invasion exponent, the sensitivity and elasticity of which can be calculated from a density-independent model. Here we examine the accuracy of two such substitutes: the dominant eigenvalue of the projection matrix evaluated at equilibrium (An??) and the dominant eigenvalue of the matrix averaged over the attractor (??). Using a two-stage model that represents a wide range of life history types, we find that the elasticities of A n?? or ?? often agree to within less than 5{\%} error with those of the invasion exponent, even when population dynamics are chaotic. The exceptions are for semelparous life histories, especially when density-dependence affects fertility. This suggests that the elasticity analysis of density-independent models near equilibrium, or averaged over the attractor, provides useful information about the elasticity of the invasion exponent in density-dependent models. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Marine temperature time series are 'redder' than atmospheric temperature time series by analogy to light: in red light, low-frequency variability has greater amplitude than high-frequency variability, whereas in white light all frequencies have the same amplitude. Differences in the relative importance of high-and low-frequency variability in different habitats affect the population dynamics of individual species and the structure of ecological communities. Population dynamics of individual species are thought to be dominated by low-frequency fluctuations, that is, to display reddened fluctuations. Here I report, however, that in eight nonlinear, iterative, deterministic, autonomous, discrete-time population models, some of which have been used to model real biological populations, the power spectral densities of chaotic trajectories are neither white nor reddened but are notably blue, with increasing power at higher frequencies.},

These parameters can be estimated from the average life history and the pattern of environmental fluctuations in the vital rates. We also show that the distribution of time to extinction (conditional on the event) depends on the magnitude but not the sign of mu.

@article{Bell1980,
abstract = {This paper identifies the effects of different types of reproductive cost on the pattern of life histories. By reproductive cost I mean the generally deleterious effect of present reproduction on future survival or fecundity or both. My approach is first to discover the circumstances in which reproduction at a given age should be maximal, and then to investigate the conditions under which reproduction at given age should be zero; this leads to a discussion first of semelparity and later of the optimal age at maturity. When all entries in the life table are independent of one another there is no reproductive cost, and it can be shown that semelparity is unlikely to evolve if maturity is delayed or if prereproductive survival is poor. The existence of a number of conspicuous exceptions to these rules points to an inadequacy in the model. Once reproductive costs are introduced, reproduction will be optimized rather than being merely maximized. The "survival cost" is the decrease in the rate of adult survival which accompanies a given increase in fecundity. If the graph of fecundity on survival is linear, semelparity will be an optimal life history provided that the slope of the graph, and thus the magnitude of the survival cost, does not exceed a quantity which can be defined mathematically. More generally, the graph of fecundity on survival will be curvilinear. If it is convex upwards there will be a stable equilibrium at which a given combination of survival and fecundity maximizes fitness; if it is concave upward there will be a point of unstable equilibrium at which some combination of survival and fecundity minimizes fitness. Semelparity may evolve either through selection toward a stable equilibrium or through selection away from an unstable equilibrium. The latter route seems to be responsible for the evolution of semelparity in some North American salmonids. The same principles continue to hold in fluctuating environments, but the evolution of semelparity is further favored if variation in prereproductive survival is less than variation in adult survival. Delayed maturation, either in semelparous or in iteroparous species, may be favorably selected given that a survival cost exists, if fecundity increases with age (the "actual fecundity cost"). This idea is supported by the facts that poikilotherms usually mature later in life than homoiotherms, that females mature later than males among poikilotherms, and that males mature later than females among homoiotherms. A necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of an optimal age at maturity is that present reproduction should cause a decrease in potential future fecundity (the "potential fecundity cost"); a sufficient condition is that the potential fecundity cost should decrease with age relative to the actual fecundity cost. Potential fecundity costs appear to be widespread amongst poikilotherms, and their general use in interpreting ages at maturity is explained. Methods of finding the optimal age at maturity are outlined, and the estimated optima are compared with the mean ages at maturity in two poikilotherms. Finally, I argue that experimental tests of life history theory are not yet feasible, and that we must instead rely on comparative techniques. After criticizing a number of recent comparative studies on methodological grounds, I suggest areas in which further research should be undertaken, and conclude by stressing the importance of life histories to general evolutionary theory.

abstract = {Decades of research on human fertility has presented a clear picture of how fertility varies, including its dramatic decline over the last two centuries in most parts of the world. Why fertility varies, both between and within populations, is not nearly so well understood. Fertility is a complex phenomenon, partly physiologically and partly behaviourally determined, thus an interdisciplinary approach is required to understand it. Evolutionary demographers have focused on human fertility since the 1980s. The first wave of evolutionary demographic research made major theoretical and empirical advances, investigating variation in fertility primarily in terms of fitness maximization. Research focused particularly on variation within high-fertility populations and small-scale subsistence societies and also yielded a number of hypotheses for why fitness maximization seems to break down as fertility declines during the demographic transition. A second wave of evolutionary demography research on fertility is now underway, paying much more attention to the cultural and psychological mechanisms underpinning fertility. It is also engaging with the complex, multi-causal nature of fertility variation, and with understanding fertility in complex modern and transitioning societies. Here, we summarize the history of evolutionary demographic work on human fertility, describe the current state of the field, and suggest future directions.},

abstract = {The idea that trade-offs between offspring quantity and quality shape repro- ductive behaviour has long been central to economic perspectives on fertility. It also has a parallel and richer theoretical foundation in evolutionary ecology.We review the application of the quantity–quality trade-off concept to humanreproduction,emphasizing distinctions between clutch size and life- time fertility, and the wider set of forces contributing to fertility variation in iteroparous and sexually reproducing species like our own. We then argue that in settings approximating human evolutionary history, several factors limit costly sibling competition. Consequently, while the optimization of quantity–quality trade-offs undoubtedly shaped the evolution of human physiology setting the upper limits of reproduction, we argue it plays a modest role in accounting for socio-ecological and individual variation in fertility. Only upon entering the demographic transition can fertility limita- tion be clearly interpreted as strategically orientated to advancing offspring quality via increased parental investment per child, with low fertility increas- ing descendant socio-economic success, although not reproductive success. We conclude that existing economic and evolutionary literature has often over- emphasized the centrality of quantity–quality trade-offs to human fertility variation and advocate for the development of more holistic frameworks encompassing alternative life-history trade-offs and the evolved mechanisms guiding their resolution.},

abstract = {1. Demographic models describe population dynamics in terms of the movement of individuals among states (e.g. size, age, developmental stage, parity, frailty, physiological condition). Matrix population models originally classified individuals by a single characteristic. This was enlarged to two characteristics in vec-permutation mod- els and the closely relatedmegamatrixmodels. However, it has been recognised that the interplay ofmore than two characteristics can affect the population dynamics. 2. Here, we present a framework, called hyperstate matrix model, in which individualsmay be classified by any number of characteristics, using the generalisation of the vec-permutation approach to hypermatrices. These models are constructed froma simple block-diagonalmatrix formulation of the movement of individuals among each dimension of the i-state. 3. This framework provides a step-by-step construction and makes available the usual demographic analysis developed for classicalmatrixmodels. In particular,we derive a general formula for the sensitivity of any output of the hyperstatematrixmodel, to any vector of parameters. Inspite of the technicalities underlying thesemodels, implementation is straightforward andwe provide theMATLABcode to carry it out. 4. We apply this approach to a three-dimensional example in which individuals are classified by developmental stage, age and heterogeneity classes. The analysis of thismodel provides insights into how the heritability of the heterogeneity classes affects the long-term growth rate of the population. 5. As the questions in conservation biology become more sophisticated and data on threatened species become more detailed, multiple dimensions in demographic models will become increasingly important. Hyperstate matrix methods will make such analyses possible and directly applicable to conservation and population management.},

abstract = {Biodemography is increasingly focused on the large and persistent differences between individuals within populations in fitness components (age at death, reproductive success) and fitness-related components (health, biomarkers) in humans and other species. To study such variation we propose the use of dynamic models of observable phenotypes of individuals. Phenotypic change in turn determines variation among individuals in their fitness components over the life course. We refer to this dynamic accumulation of fitness differences as dynamic heterogeneity and illustrate it for an animal population in which longitudinal data are studied using multistate capture-mark-recapture models. Although our approach can be applied to any characteristic, for our empirical example we use reproduction as the phenotypic character to define stages. We indicate how our stage-structured model describes the nature of the variation among individual characteristics that is generated by dynamic heterogeneity. We conclude by discussing our ongoing and planned work on animals and humans. We also discuss the connections between our work and recent work on human mortality, disability and health, and life course theory.},

@article{Stott2010a,
abstract = {1. Population projection matrices (PPMs) are probably the most commonly used empirical population models. To be useful for predictive or prospective analyses, PPM models should generally be irreducible (the associated life cycle graph contains the necessary transition rates to facilitate pathways from all stages to all other stages) and therefore ergodic (whatever initial stage structure is used in the population projection, it will always exhibit the same stable asymptotic growth rate). 2. Evaluation of 652 PPM models for 171 species from the literature suggests that 24{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} of PPM models are reducible (parameterized transition rates do not facilitate pathways from all stages to all other stages). Reducible models are sometimes ergodic but may be non-ergodic (the model exhibits two or more stable asymptotic states with different asymptotic stable growth rates, which depend on the initial stage structure used in the population projection). In our sample of published PPMs, 15{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} are non-ergodic. 3. This presents a problem: reducible–ergodic models often defy biological rationale in their description of the life cycle but may or may not prove problematic for analysis as they often behave similarly to irreducible models. Reducible–non-ergodic models will usually defy biological rationale in their description of the both the life cycle and population dynamics, hence contravening most analytical methods. 4. We provide simple methods to evaluate reducibility and ergodicity of PPM models, present illustrative examples to elucidate the relationship between reducibility and ergodicity and provide empirical examples to evaluate the implications of these properties in PPM models. 5. As a prevailing tool for population ecologists, PPM models need to be as predictive as possible. However, there is a large incidence of reducibility in published PPMs, with significant implications for the predictive power of such models in many cases. We suggest that as a general rule, reducibility of PPM models should be avoided. However, we provide a guide to the pertinent analysis of reducible matrix models, largely based upon whether they are ergodic or not.},

@article{Hawkes2010,
abstract = {In the first paper to present formal theory explaining that senescence is a consequence of natural selection, W. D. Hamilton concluded that human postmenopausal longevity results from the contributions of ancestral grandmothers to the reproduction of their relatives. A grandmother hypothesis, subsequently elaborated with additional lines of evidence, helps explain both exceptional longevity and additional features of life history that distinguish humans from the other great apes. However, some of the variation observed in aging rates seems inconsistent with the tradeoffs between current and future reproduction identified by theory. In humans and chimpanzees, our nearest living relatives, individuals who bear offspring at faster rates do not cease bearing sooner. They continue to be fertile longer instead. Furthermore, within both species, groups with lower overall mortality rates have faster rates of increase in death risk with advancing age. These apparent contradictions to the expected life history tradeoffs likely result from heterogeneity in frailty among individuals. Whereas robust and frail alike must allocate investments between current and future reproduction, the more robust can afford more of both. This heterogeneity, combined with evolutionary tradeoffs and the key role of ancestral grandmothers they identify, helps explain aspects of human aging that increasingly concern us all.},

Traditional hypotheses assume that the small body size of human pygmies is an adaptation to special challenges, such as thermoregulation, locomotion in dense forests, or endurance against starvation. Here, we present an analysis of stature, growth, and individual fitness for a large population of Aeta and a smaller one of Batak from the Philippines and compare it with data on other pygmy groups accumulated by anthropologists for a century. The results challenge traditional explanations of human pygmy body size. We argue that human pygmy populations and adaptations evolved independently as the result of a life history tradeoff between the fertility benefits of larger body size against the costs of late growth cessation, under circumstances of significant young and adult mortality. Human pygmies do not appear to have evolved through positive selection for small stature-this was a by-product of selection for early onset of reproduction.},

abstract = {The shape of the association between age and the cost of reproduction varies across species. However, it is unclear whether there are any general patterns in the way the cost of reproduction varies with life history, taxon or ecological function. Using a simple theoretical method, we identified three characteristic patterns to describe the age-related survival cost of reproduction. The most frequent pattern is an approximately exponential decay (ED) with increasing age. Two additional u-shaped patterns were identified, where the cost of reproduction was higher for young and old individuals compared with intermediate-aged individuals. The majority of these u-shaped curves suggested higher costs of reproduction at older ages (RQ), with the rest suggesting a higher cost at young ages (LQ). While predators were most likely to exhibit ED-shaped cost curves, herbivores were equally likely to exhibit ED and RQ curves; birds were likely to exhibit ED-shaped curves and mammals were split equally between ED and RQ curves. These findings suggest that there may be predictable differences in the age-related shape of the cost of reproduction between species, but further research is required to identify the mechanisms generating such differences.},

abstract = {An increasing number of studies have documented phenotypic selection on life-history traits in human populations, but less is known of the heritability and genetic constraints that mediate the response to selection on life-history traits in humans. We collected pedigree data for four generations of preindustrial (1745-1900) Finns who lived in premodern fertility and mortality conditions, and by using a restricted maximum-likelihood animal-model framework, we estimated the heritability of and genetic correlations between a suite of life-history traits and two alternative measures of fitness. First, we demonstrate high heritability of key life-history traits (fecundity, interbirth interval, age at last reproduction, and adult longevity) and measures of fitness (individual lambda and lifetime reproductive success) for females but not for males. This sex difference may have arisen because most of the measured traits are under physiological control of the female, such that a male's fitness in monogamous societies may depend mainly on the reproductive quality of his spouse. We found strong positive genetic correlations between female age at first reproduction and longevity, and between interbirth intervals and longevity, suggesting reduced life spans in females who either started to breed relatively early or who then bred frequently. Our results suggest that key female life-history traits in this premodern human population had high heritability and may have responded to natural selection. However genetic constraints between longevity and reproductive life-history traits may have constrained the evolution of life history and facilitated the maintenance of additive genetic variance in key life-history traits.},

abstract = {This article is concerned with relating the stability of a population, as defined by the rate of decay of fluctuations induced by demographic stochasticity, with its heterogeneity in age-specific birth and death rates. We invoke the theory of large deviations to establish a fluctuation theorem: The demographic stability of a population is positively correlated with evolutionary entropy, a measure of the variability in the age of reproducing individuals in the population. This theorem is exploited to predict certain correlations between ecological constraints and evolutionary trends in demographic stability, namely, (i) bounded growth constraints - a uni-directional increase in stability, (ii) unbounded growth constraints (large population size) - a uni-directional decrease in stability, (iii) unbounded growth constraints (small population size) - random, non-directional change in stability. These principles relating ecological constraints with trends in demographic stability are shown to be far reaching generalizations of the tenets derived from classical studies of stability in an evolutionary context. These results thus provide a new conceptual framework for explaining patterns of variation in population numbers observed in natural populations. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {It is an axiom of life-history theory that reproduction involves age-specific costs in terms of survival or future reproduction. The measurement of costs of reproduction in plants is difficult, and few field studies have measured these costs in terms of fitness or demographic components, thus creating a hiatus between theory and data. In this article, we describe methods for overcoming the problem, illustrated by a field study of balsam fir. We used serial correlation and a permutation test to detect growth costs of reproduction and show how these translate into demographic costs when relative tree size (and therefore growth) is critical to survival. Using chronosequences, we reconstructed the age- and size-specific dynamics of a subalpine population of Abies balsamea. A matrix model describing these dynamics was then used to estimate age- and size-specific probabilities of future survival to maturity (Zix). By using a regression model of the relationship between tree size, age, and Zix, we were able to estimate the maximum age-specific demographic cost of reproduction for trees of all ages. The shape of the age-specific cost curve for A. balsamea may explain why, contrary to a previously published hypothesis, age at first reproduction in A. balsamea does not vary between wave-regenerating and normal populations.},

abstract = {This article establishes for a class of evolutionary processes, a directionality theorem which is an analogue of the second law of thermodynamics. For populations evolving under limited resource conditions the effect of mutation and selection will result in the spontaneous transition from one stationary state to another. We show that this transition is described by an increase in population entropy, a parameter which measures the diversity of lineages induced by the birth and death rates of the individuals in the population. The second law of thermodynamics refers to systems in an adiabatic enclosure and describe an increase in geometric complexity as the system moves from one equilibrium steady state to another. The directionality theorem in evolutionary dynamics refers to populations subject to limited resource conditions and describes an increase in dynamic complexity as the system moves from one nonequilibrium steady state to another. We invoke a formal correspondence between the evolutionary parameter, generation time and the thermodynamic parameter, temperature, established in J. Stat. Phys. 30 (1983) 709, to show that in populations evolving under the additional constraint of constant generation time, the increase in population entropy reduces to an increase in geometric complexity, a property which is formally identical to the second law. ?? 1992.},

In this note we propose a simple model that explains this failure. The aim of our model is to try to understand the observations of positive correlations between life history traits where trade-offs, and hence negative correlations, are expected. It is assumed that the amount of resources that individuals can spend on life history traits varies between individuals. When some individuals spend much on several life history traits and others spend little, positive correlations are observed. Whether the observed correlations between life history traits are negative or positive depends on the relative variation in the acquisition and the variation in the allocation of resources.},

These proofs are efficient and expedient, but they give little direct insight into the mechanism that causes ergodicity. This paper proposes a simple and unified proof of the two ergodic theorems. It is shown that the birth dynamics can be decomposed into a smoothing process that progressively levels out past fluctuations in the birth sequence and a reshaping process that accounts for current period-to-period changes in vital rates. The smoothing process, which causes the birth sequence to lose information on its past shape, is shown to be the ergodic mechanism behind both theorems.},

Using a relation between these measures and the Malthusian parameter, it is shown that in a random mating population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and under slow selection, the rate of change of entropy is equal to the genetic variance in entropy minus the genetic covariance of entropy and reproductive potential.

This expression is derived in the first place for females on the stable assumption; extension to both sexes is provided, and comparison with real populations shows the numerical error to be small where fertility has not yet started to drop. The result (9) tells how the lower limit of the ultimate population depends on parameters of the existing population, and for values typical of underdeveloped countries works out to about 1.6. If a delay of 15 years occurs before the drop of the birth rate to replacement the population will multiply by over 2.5 before attaining stationarity. The ultimate population actually reached will be higher insofar as death rates continue to improve. If stability cannot be assumed the ultimate stationary population is provided by the more general expression (7), which is still easier to calculate than a detailed projection.},

abstract = {Transfers of resources between generations are an essential element in current models of human life-history evolution accounting for prolonged development, extended lifespan and menopause. Integrating these models with Hamilton's theory of inclusive fitness, we predict that the interaction of biological kinship with the age-schedule of resource production should be a key driver of intergenerational transfers. In the empirical case of Tsimane' forager-horticulturalists in Bolivian Amazonia, we provide a detailed characterization of net transfers of food according to age, sex, kinship and the net need of donors and recipients. We show that parents, grandparents and siblings provide significant net downward transfers of food across generations. We demonstrate that the extent of provisioning responds facultatively to variation in the productivity and demographic composition of families, as predicted by the theory. We hypothesize that the motivation to provide these critical transfers is a fundamental force that binds together human nuclear and extended families. The ubiquity of three-generational families in human societies may thus be a direct reflection of fundamental evolutionary constraints on an organism's life-history and social organization.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to determine the likelihood and net amount of parent-child transfers over the adult life cycle across European welfare regimes. The study introduces an economic life-cycle model of family transfers to describe the evolution of family exchanges across generations over time, which reveals a nonlinear relationship of age and net family transfers. Furthermore, it refines the method of estimating parent-child net transfers. Data come from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe, and include 36,095 parent-child dyads from 11 European countries representing social democratic, conservative, and traditional welfare-state regimes. The findings reveal net value of family intergenerational support follows a nonlinear pattern across the adult life cycle, with positive transfers from parents to adult children decreasing modestly until advanced old age when the decrease intensifies. Net family support benefits individuals and generations with larger relative need. The transition in the net family support pattern starts later and is less pronounced across social democratic welfare-regime countries while the opposite is true in traditional welfare-regime countries. These findings might be interpreted as being linked to differences in the public policies guaranteeing different levels of provision for dependent populations across different welfare regimes. They are consistent with a comparatively smaller role of family support in the intergenerational redistribution of resources in societies with larger public intergenerational support to dependent populations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This phenomenon is called menopause or more generally the post-reproductive lifespan (PRLS). The question is to know, how can this happen and why is it more beneficial to live longer when we do not reproduce anymore ? The factors influencing PRLS of metazoans is a well studied topic over the past decades. We reported a lot of factors increasing or decreasing PRLS among animals, mostly in mammals. There are non-evolutive explanations for the emergence of PRLS, which could be an artifact of the increasing lifespan. But two main evolutive theories have raised a lot of interests: [1] the grandmother hypothesis, which predicts that non reproductive mother help their daughter to reproduce, [2] the mother hypothesis, which assumes that mother stop reproducing to avoid risks related to childbirth, for her and their existing offspring. The discussion about the emergence of menopause still in debate.},

abstract = {Reproduction timing is one of the most important factors for the life history because it is closely related to subsistence of species. On the other hand, ecological demographers recently noted the effects of environmental stochasticity on the population dynamics by using linear demographic models because stochasticity reduces the population growth rate. Linear demographic models are generally composed of reproduction timing, several life history traits and stochasticity. The stochasticity is generated by twofold stochasticity, that is, internal and external stochasticities. In transition matrix models, the internal stochasticity gives a species a set of transition probabilities to other states, whereas the external stochasticity annually variegates the value of these transition probabilities. If the population vector has only the internal stochasticity, it satisfies a partial differential equation, in which it is described by a stochasticity in body-size growth rate.In this paper, we focus on the stochasticity which affects the body-size growth rate under r-selection. We construct a mathematical model of stochastic life history of each individual by using a stochastic differential equation, and analyze the relationship between optimal life schedule and the population dynamics by finding Euler-Lotka equation. Then, we use the formalism of path-integral expression to the population dynamics and show that the expression is consistent with other expressions in linear demographic models. Finally, we apply our method to a simple example, and obtain a characteristic of the stochasticity which has not only negative effect on the fitness but also positive effect from our model. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {That senescence is rarely, if ever, observed in natural populations is an oft-quoted fallacy within bio-gerontology. We identify the roots of this fallacy in the otherwise seminal works of Medawar and Comfort, and explain that under antagonistic pleiotropy or disposable soma explanations for the evolution of senescence there is no reason why senescence cannot evolve to be manifest within the life expectancies of wild organisms. The recent emergence of long-term field studies presents irrefutable evidence that senescence is commonly detected in nature. We found such evidence in 175 different animal species from 340 separate studies. Although the bulk of this evidence comes from birds and mammals, we also found evidence for senescence in other vertebrates and insects. We describe how high-quality longitudinal field data allow us to test evolutionary explanations for differences in senescence between the sexes and among traits and individuals. Recent studies indicate that genes, prior environment and investment in growth and reproduction influence aging rates in the wild. We argue that - with the fallacy that wild animals do not senesce finally dead and buried - collaborations between bio-gerontologists and field biologists can begin to test the ecological generality of purportedly 'public' mechanisms regulating aging in laboratory models.},

Some differences are attributable to initial maternal handicaps (birth or hatching asynchrony, differences in egg or neonate size and hormonal or antioxidant titre); but differences among siblings may also arise from differences in the brood-rearing environment that offspring experience. Here, I use a model system--a long-term study of nestlings in an altricial bird--to study how an initial maternal handicap, hatching asynchrony, regulates the effective social environment of siblings in the same family as measured by offspring survival. The interaction of family size and structure generated wide differences in the effective environments of siblings living in the same physical space (a nest), and reared by the same parents, in the same family structure. Social rank was the key component of the unshared environment of contemporary siblings, and was alone sufficient to generate near-maximal differences in offspring performance.

abstract = {The age-specific mortality curve for many species, including humans, is U-shaped: mortality declines with age in the developing cohort (ontogenescence) before increasing with age (senescence). The field of evolutionary demography has long focused on understanding the evolution of senescence while largely failing to address the evolution of ontogenescence. The current review is the first to gather the few avail- able hypotheses addressing the evolution of ontogenescence, examine the basis and assumptions of each and ask what the phylogenetic extent of ontogenescence may be. Ontogenescence is among the most widespread of life-history traits, occurring in every population for which I have found sufficiently detailed data, in major groups throughout the eukaryotes, across many causes of death and many life-history types. Hypotheses seeking to explain ontogenescence include those based on kin selection, the acquisition of robustness, heterogeneous frailties and life-history optimization. I propose a further hypothesis, arguing that mortality drops with age because most transitions that could trigger the risks caused by genetic and developmental malfunctions are concentrated in early life. Of these hypotheses, only those that frame ontogenescence as an evolutionary by-product rather than an adaptation can explain the tremendous diversity of organisms and environments in which it occurs.},

@article{Rogers2011,
abstract = {The causes of socioeconomic inequality have been debated since the time of Plato. Many reasons for the development of stratification have been proposed, from the need for hierarchical control over large-scale irrigation systems to the accumulation of small differences in wealth over time via inheritance processes. However, none of these explains how unequal societies came to completely displace egalitarian cultural norms over time. Our study models demographic consequences associated with the unequal distribution of resources in stratified societies. Agent-based simulation results show that in constant environments, unequal access to resources can be demographically destabilizing, resulting in the outward migration and spread of such societies even when population size is relatively small. In variable environments, stratified societies spread more and are also better able to survive resource shortages by sequestering mortality in the lower classes. The predictions of our simulation are provided modest support by a range of existing empirical studies. In short, the fact that stratified societies today vastly outnumber egalitarian societies may not be due to the transformation of egalitarian norms and structures, but may instead reflect the more rapid migration of stratified societies and consequent conquest or displacement of egalitarian societies over time.},

abstract = {In age-classified population models where all parameters are known, the generation time and growth rate are calculated in a straightforward manner. For many populations, some parameters, such as juvenile survival, are difficult to estimate accurately. In a simplified population model where fecundity and survival are constant from the onset of breeding, it is known that generation time may be calculated given only adult survival, age at first reproduction, and the population growth rate. However, the assumption of constant fecundity from the onset of breeding does not hold for many populations. An extended population model allows calculation of generation time with the additional knowledge of the ratio of age-specific fecundities compared to a maximum fecundity rate. When these relative fecundities are unknown, an ad hoc adjustment to the simplified model performs well. When the study population is in an ideal environment, the optimal generation time and maximum growth rate are linked, and both may be approximated knowing only adult survival, age at first reproduction, and the relative fecundities. The maximum growth rate has important conservation implications, and calculating it correctly is therefore important. Improper use of the simplified population model to calculate the maximum growth rate, combined with a simple decision rule, leads to an average overharvest of 36{\%}, and {\textgreater}60{\%} for three of six bird species studied, compared to the full population model. By comparison, using the approximation from the extended or adjusted models results in average overharvests of only 8{\%} (extended model) and 5{\%} (adjusted model), and {\textless}50{\%} for all six species (either model). ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper presents a new two-sex learning- and skills-based theory for the evolution of human menopause. The theory proposes that the role of knowledge, skill acquisition, and transfers in determining economic productivity and resource distribution is the distinctive feature of the traditional human ecology that is responsible for the evolution of menopause. The theory also proposes that male reproductive cessation and post-reproductive investment in descendants is a fundamental characteristic of humans living in traditional foraging and simple horticultural economies. We present evidence relevant to the theory. The data show that whereas reproductive decline is linked to increasing risks of mortality in chimpanzees, human reproductive senescence precedes somatic senescence. Moreover under traditional conditions, most human males undergo reproductive cessation at the same time as their wives. We then present evidence that after ceasing to reproduce, both men and women provide net economic transfers to children and grandchildren. Given this pattern of economic productivity, delays in menopause would produce net economic deficits within families.},

abstract = {Human hunting is arguably one of the most difficult activities common to foraging peoples now and in the past. Children and teenagers have usually been described as incompetent hunters in ethnographies of hunter-gatherers. This paper explores the extent to which adult-level competence is limited more by the constraints of physical capital, or body size, and brain-based capital, or skills and learning. The grandmother hypothesis requires that production is an increasing function of size alone, while the embodied capital model stipulates that production is a function of both size and delayed learning. Tests based on observational, interview, and experimental data collected among Tsimane Amerindians of the Bolivian Amazon suggest that size alone cannot explain the long delay until peak hunting productivity. Indirect encounters (e.g., smells, sounds, tracks, and scat) and shooting of stationary targets are two components of hunting ability limited primarily by physical size alone, but the more difficult components of hunting--direct encounters with important prey items and successful capture--require substantial skill. Those skills can take an additional ten to twenty years to develop after achieving adult body size.},

In addition, several new results are introduced to clearly illustrate similarities between the models. Specifically, the relations between the mean persistence time and higher-order moments for discrete-time Markov chain models, continuous-time Markov chain models, and stochastic differential equation models are compared for populations experiencing demographic variability. Similarities between the models are demonstrated analytically, and computational results are provided to show that estimated persistence times for the three stochastic models are generally in good agreement when the models are consistently formulated. As an example, the three stochastic models are applied to a population satisfying logistic growth. Logistic growth is interesting as different birth and death rates can yield the same logistic differential equation. However, the persistence behavior of the population is strongly dependent on the explicit forms for the birth and death rates. Computational results demonstrate how dramatically the mean persistence time can vary for different populations that experience the same logistic growth. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We applied four tests to detect evidence of the evolution of senescence in life tables and fecundity schedules for 65 species of iteroparous perennial plants. Test 1 determined the pattern of variation in age-specific mortality with age (µx in, or maximum value of, µx ). Fifty-five percent of species showed an increase at the end of life. In test 2, we tried to separate mortality into initial or baseline mortality and senescent mortality by fitting the survival data of these 65 species to Weibull functions. Unlike published results with animals, the rate of senescence was inde- pendent of initial mortality rate. However, a positive relationship was found between rate of senescence and reproductive lifespan, suggesting increasing risk of death with successive repro- ductive events. It has been suggested that a decline in reproductive value with age is a better diagnostic of senescence, but (in test 3) this occurred in only 9{\%} of species (6/65). Our fourth test detected a positive correlation between age at first reproduction ($\alpha$) and mean reproductive lifespan (L$\alpha$ survival and reproduction. Comparing species within the two largest families present in the data set, we found a correlation between $\alpha$ and L$\alpha$ ), as predicted by the theory that senescence is due to a trade-off between adult among the Liliaceae, which was largely represented by ramet life tables, but not among the Poaceae, which was largely represented by genet life tables. Clonal growth, which is common in plants, is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to prevent the evolution of senescence. We predict that clones that fragment are more likely to escape the evolution of senescence at the genet level than clones that remain physiologically integrated.},

Conceptually and empirically, momentum and aging express the same change, albeit on different scales. Fundamentally, they are two manifestations of the underlying process of demographic transformation. We consider three measures of aging over the transition to stationarity: the increase in mean population age, the decrease in the proportion under age 30, and the increase in the proportion over age 65. The three measures of aging are highly correlated, though the relationship to momentum is weakest for the increase in the proportion over age 65. We find that momentum is linearly related to aging. In both model and actual populations, a one-year increase in mean age translates into about 4.5{\%} more population growth. The population below age 30 does not grow over the transition to stationarity and the ratio of initial to ultimate proportions under age 30 is virtually identical to momentum.},

abstract = {I suggest that there may be a fundamental conceptual unity between two seemingly disparate phenomena: (1) senescence (the progressive deterioration in physiological function and, thus, individual fitness with age) and (2) niche conservatism (the observation that species often seem rather fixed over evolutionary time in their basic niche properties). I argue that both phenomena arise from demographic asymmetries. The evolutionary theory of ageing rests on the observation that the force of selection declines with age, reflecting the basic demographic facts that in persistent populations there are always fewer individuals in old than in young age classes and these individuals tend to have lower reproductive value. A similar demographic asymmetry arises when populations inhabit environments with source habitats (i.e. where conditions are within the species' niche) and sink habitats (where conditions lie outside the niche): there tend to be more individuals in sources than in sinks and individuals in sources have relatively higher reproductive values. These demographic asymmetries should often imply that the force of selection is greater in sources than in sinks, leading automatically towards niche conservatism. I suggest that niche evolution is most Likely in circumstances where these demographic asymmetries in space weaken or reverse.},

abstract = {Demographic dynamics is formally equivalent to the dynamics of a Markov chain, as is true of some nonlinear dynamical systems. Convergence to demographic equilibrium can be studied in terms of convergence in the Markov chain. Tuljapurkar (1982) showed that population entropy (Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy) provides information on the rate of this convergence. This paper begins by considering finite state Markov chains, providing elementary proofs of the relationship between convergence rate and entropy, and discusses in detail the uses and limitations of entropy as a convergence measure; these results also apply to Markovian dynamical systems. Next, new qualitative and quantitative arguments are used to discuss the demographic meaning of entropy. An exact relationship is established giving population entropy in terms of the eigenvalues of the Leslie matrix characteristic equation. Finally, the significance of imprimitive and periodic limits is discussed in relation to population entropy.},

@article{Platt1988,
abstract = {We investigated the demography and spatial pattern of an old-growth longleaf pine population using a large plot in which all trees of at least 2 cm in dbh were mapped and tagged for individual recognition. The population was of uneven age and size; tree size correlated positively with tree age. Large or old trees were only loosely aggregated, forming a background matrix that filled the forest. In contrast, juvenile trees were highly aggregated and were located in areas of low adult densities. Recruitment within this population thus appears to occur primarily within open spaces created by the deaths of large trees. Variable time lags may occur before the colonization of open spaces, however, because of temporal variation in seed production and the occurrence of summer ground fires. The absence of large gaps within the age-class distribution indicated that recruitment within the mapped plot has occurred frequently for at least the past 250 years. Neither age- nor size-class distributions, however, were stable. Instead, temporal variation in adult mortality and recruitment into open spaces, coupled with strong negative interactions between cohorts of different ages, appears likely to produce alternating phases of population growth and decline that are highly variable in length and magnitude. An upper bound to population size occurs when all available space is filled with trees; but no lower bound exists, and extinction probabilities may be increased at very low densities. The population is buffered from declines to very low densities, however, by the consistent tendency for small trees to recruit into openings created by the deaths of adults. This regeneration pattern, which also occurs in other long-lived conifers, represents a spatial analogue to stochastic boundedness over time, and it may enhance the local persistence of longleaf pine populations. Efficient spatial buffering requires that open spaces not be colonized by other tree species before the establishment of longleaf recruits. We suggest that longleaf pine maintains the environment in an open state suitable for its own regeneration by transmuting a localized disturbance (lightning) into a widespread disturbance (ground fires). Fire facilitation results in an extended, but indefinite, increase in the persistence of environmental conditions in which longleaf pine, but not other tree species, can survive and reproduce. Since longleaf pine influences the fire regime, it is a key species that constitutes environmental conditions and, hence, the composition and relative abundances of other species within the habitat.},

abstract = {Mathematical models and empirical studies have revealed two potentially disruptive influences on ecosystems; (1) instabilities caused by nonlinear feedbacks and time-lags in the interactions of biological species, and (2) stochastic forcings by a fluctuating environment. Because both of these phenomena can severely affect system survival, ecologists are confronted with the question of why complex ecosystems do, in fact, exist. Our study analyzes the basic themes of this research and identifies five general hypothesis that, in recent years, theoretical ecologists have built into models to increase their stability against disruptive feedback and stochasticity. To counter feedback instabilities, theoreticians have considered (1) functional interactions between species that act as stabilizers, (2) disturbance patterns that interrupt adverse feedback effects, and (3) the stabilizing effect of integrating small-spatial-scale systems into large landscapes. To decrease the influence of stochasticity, modelers have hypothesized (4) compensatory mechanisms operating at low population densities, and (5) the moderating effect of spatial extent and heterogeneity. We show that modeling based on these ideas can be organized in a systematic way. We also show that the stable equilibrium state should not be viewed as a fundamental property of ecological systems, but as a property that can emerge asymptotically from extrapolation to sufficiently large spatial scales.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. Abstract. Great Tits (Parus major) nesting in Wytham Wood near Oxford, England, lay clutches averaging 8.53 eggs, although the most productive clutch size is 12. We eval-uated various mechanisms that have been suggested to account for this apparent disparity, including (1) cost of reproduction, (2) Mountford's "cliff-edge effect," and (3) year-to-year environmental variability. Data on 4489 clutches, including 603 manipulated clutches, from the past 24 yr, offer weak or contradictory support for the first two mechanisms. There are marked annual environmental fluctuations, and a geometric mean estimate of relative fitness best predicts the observed mean clutch size. Years that are poor for survival of young affect individuals laying larger clutches much more than they affect those laying smaller clutches. This "bad-years effect" reduces the mean and increases the variance in fitness for individuals laying large clutches more than it does for individuals laying smaller clutches. Hence it is more advantageous, in the long term, for birds to lay clutches smaller than the most productive clutch size. The cost of reproduction as it affects adult survival is neither necessary nor sufncient for clutch size optimization in Great Tits.},

Intergenerational event histories are used to explore the relationships between mothers' and daughters' completed family size. Results suggest that daughters' fertility levels are responsive to their mothers' relative fertility and age at marriage (as compared with mother's contemporaries). Effects of exposure to a number of younger siblings, controlling for cohort biases, are also examined. A multivariate proportional hazard analysis of daughter's age at marriage and parity-specific birth intervals demonstrates the direct and indirect effects of intergenerational fertility associations on fertility timing.

@article{Goodman1982,
abstract = {Reproductive value is the central construct in life history optimization. In the optimal life history, the reproductive value at every age represents the solution to a constrained maximization problem. This holds true regardless of trade-offs across age classes. The recent literature arguing to the contrary has misunderstood the principle and has neglected the constraints in the maximization. In reviewing the matter, this paper considers maximization over segments of the life history, maximization over segments taken in reverse sequence, maximization of terms of a decomposition into instantaneous contributions at a given age, and maximization of reproductive value over alternative states such as the sexes. To clarify the relation between the maximization procedure and the constraints, a simple iterative approach to achieving maximization and simultaneously satisfying the constraints is described. To arrive at the instantaneous decomposition, it is shown that reproductive value arises as an adjoint variable in an optimal control formulation, where effects across age classes are explicitly incorporated in a variable representing physiological state. In considering alternative states, this paper defines a male reproductive value and concludes that at equilibrium sex composition, the reproductive values of each sex will be equal at any age where a sex change is possible. Coincidentally, some common errors in the discrete time formulation of reproductive value and Lotka's equation are corrected.},

In an age-structured population that experiences a sequence of independently and identically distributed Leslie matrices, the expectation of the Malthusian parameters of the Leslie matrices has no exact interpretation either as the ensemble average of the long-run rate of growth of each sample path of the population (Eq. (3)) or as the long-run rate of growth of the ensemble average of total population size (Eq. (4)). On the other hand, the Malthusian parameter of the expectation of a sequence of Leslie matrices is exactly the logarithm of the finite growth rate of the ensemble average of total population size when Leslie matrices are independently and identically distributed (though not in general when Leslie matrices are sequentially dependent). These observations appear to contradict the claims of a recent study using computer simulation of age-structured populations with stochastically varying vital rates. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

Many methods have been proposed to forecast four demographic components, namely mortality, fertility, emigration and immigration. These existing methods are sometimes considered from a deterministic viewpoint, which in practice can be quite restrictive. The statistical method we propose is a multilevel functional data analytic approach, where the mortality and migration for females and males are modelled and forecasted jointly. The forecast uncertainty associated with each component is incorporated through bootstrapping. Using the historical data for the United Kingdom from 1975 to 2009, we found that the proposed method shows good in-sample forecast accuracy for the holdout data between years 2000 and 2009. Moreover, we produce out-of-sample population forecasts from 2010 to 2030, and compare our forecasts with those produced by the Office for National Statistics.},

abstract = {Verbal and mathematical models that consider the costs and benefits of behavioral strategies have been useful in explaining animal behavior and are often used as the basis of evolutionary explanations of human behavior. In most cases, however, these models do not account for the effects that group structure and cultural traditions within a human population have on the costs and benefits of its members' decisions. Nor do they consider the likelihood that cultural as well as genetic traits will be subject to natural selection. In this paper, we present an agent-based model that incorporates some key aspects of human social structure and life history. We investigate the evolution of a population under conditions of different environmental harshness and in which selection can occur at the level of the group as well as the level of the individual. We focus on the evolution of a socially learned characteristic related to individuals' willingness to contribute to raising the offspring of others within their family group. We find that environmental harshness increases the frequency of individuals who make such contributions. However, under the conditions we stipulate, we also find that environmental variability can allow groups to survive with lower frequencies of helpers. The model presented here is inevitably a simplified representation of a human population, but it provides a basis for future modeling work toward evolutionary explanations of human behavior that consider the influence of both genetic and cultural transmission of behavior.},

This paper compares the effect of early parental loss on child survival in the past in the Krummh{\"{o}}rn region of East Frisia (Germany) and among the French Canadians settlers of the Saint-Lawrence Valley (Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada). The Krummh{\"{o}}rn region was characterized by a saturated habitat, while the opportunities for establishing a new family were virtually unlimited for the French Canadian settlers. Early parental loss had quite different consequences in these dissimilar environments. Event history analyses with time-varying specification of family structure are used on a sample of 7,077 boys and 6,906 girls born between 1720 and 1859 in the Krummh{\"{o}}rn region and 31,490 boys and 33,109 girls whose parents married between 1670 and 1750 in Qu{\'{e}}bec. Results indicate that in both populations parental loss is associated with increased infant and child mortality. Maternal loss has a universal and consistent effect for both sexes, while the impact of paternal loss is less easy to establish and to interpret. On the other hand, the effect of the remarriage of the surviving spouse is population-specific: Mother's remarriage has no effect in Krummh{\"{o}}rn, while it is beneficial in Qu{\'{e}}bec. In contrast, father's remarriage in Krummh{\"{o}}rn dramatically reduces the survival chances of the children born from his former marriage, while such effect is not seen for Qu{\'{e}}bec. These population-specific effects appear to be driven by the availability of resources and call into question the universality of the “Cinderella” effect.},

abstract = {Intergenerational transfer of wealth has been proposed as playing a pivotal role in the evolution of human sibling relationships. Sibling rivalry is assumed to be more marked when offspring compete for limited heritable resources, which are crucial for reproductive success (e.g., land and livestock); whereas in the absence of heritable wealth, related siblings may cooperate. To date, comparative studies undertaken to support this evolutionary assumption have been confounded by other socioecological factors, which vary across populations, e.g., food sharing and intergroup conflict. In this article we explore effects of sibling competition and cooperation for agricultural resources, marriage, and reproduction in one contemporary Ethiopian agropastoralist society. Here recent changes in land tenure policy, altering transfers of land from parents to offspring, present a unique framework to test the importance of intergenerational transfers of wealth in driving sibling competition, while controlling for socioeconomic biases. In households where land is inherited, the number of elder brothers reduces a man's agricultural productivity, marriage, and reproductive success, as resources diminish and competition increases with each additional sibling. Where land is not inherited (for males receiving land directly from the government and all females) older siblings do not have a competitive effect and in some instances may be beneficial. This study has wider implications for the evolution of human family sizes. Recent changes in wealth transfers, which have driven sibling competition, may be contributing to an increased desire for smaller family sizes.},

abstract = {This note deals with the calculation of the generation time, $\mu$1, understood as the mean age of parents at reproduction. Recently, Caswell (2009) gave an expression for calculating it using matrix models and a difference of one unit of time (that may be a day or a year) has been detected in comparison to other suggested expressions. We show that the difference is due to underlying assumptions that we expose here. An individual produces a random number n of offspring at times x1, x2, x3, {\ldots}, xn, where xi is a continuous random variable called ‘Generation time'. Its expected value, $\mu$1, sometimes called by itself generation time, is an important parameter in demography. In practice, the xi's are not registered since most of the time population is counted at discrete intervals t = 1, 2, 3,{\ldots} and what is recorded is the number of individuals produced during every interval. Survival probabilities for parents are also calculated and thus we obtain two quantities for every interval: l(j), the probability that an individual survives up to the j-th interval and m(j), the offspring produced in that interval. Since the exact times of birth were not observed, the average time of births within an interval is credited to be c units from the beginning of the interval. This information can be concentrated and analyzed in two ways: using Life tables, or using Matrix population models.},

abstract = {Studying fitness consequences of variable behavioural, physiological and cognitive traits in contemporary populations constitutes the specific contribution of human behavioural ecology to the study of human diversity. Yet, despite 30 years of evolutionary anthropological interest in the determinants of fitness, there exist few principled investigations of the diverse sources of wealth that might reveal selective forces during recent human history. To develop a more holistic understanding of how selection shapes human phenotypic traits, be these transmitted by genetic or cultural means, we expand the conventional focus on associations between socioeconomic status and fitness to three distinct types of wealth-embodied, material and relational. Using a model selection approach to the study of women's success in raising offspring in an African horticultural population (the Tanzanian Pimbwe), we find that the top performing models consistently include relational and material wealth, with embodied wealth as a less reliable predictor. Specifically, child mortality risk is increased with few household assets, parent nonresidency, child legitimacy, and one or more parents having been accused of witchcraft. The use of multiple models to test various hypotheses greatly facilitates systematic comparative analyses of human behavioural diversity in wealth accrual and investment across different kinds of societies.},

abstract = {Chromatin modifiers regulate lifespan in several organisms, raising the question of whether changes in chromatin states in the parental generation could be incompletely reprogrammed in the next generation and thereby affect the lifespan of descendants. The histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) complex, composed of ASH-2, WDR-5 and the histone methyltransferase SET-2, regulates Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan. Here we show that deficiencies in the H3K4me3 chromatin modifiers ASH-2, WDR-5 or SET-2 in the parental generation extend the lifespan of descendants up until the third generation. The transgenerational inheritance of lifespan extension by members of the ASH-2 complex is dependent on the H3K4me3 demethylase RBR-2, and requires the presence of a functioning germline in the descendants. Transgenerational inheritance of lifespan is specific for the H3K4me3 methylation complex and is associated with epigenetic changes in gene expression. Thus, manipulation of specific chromatin modifiers only in parents can induce an epigenetic memory of longevity in descendants.},

abstract = {Human pair-bonding and paternal involvement have long been attributed to the need for biparental rearing of altricial offspring with extended periods of dependency. More recently, researchers have focused on the fertility benefits that pair-bonding offers men and have re-conceptualized paternal care as a stratagem designed to curry favor with the recipient children's mother. These models, however, fail to explain a number of puzzling empirical findings, namely the lack of a significant and robust effect of father-presence cross-culturally, despite what appears to be true paternal involvement. I argue that the record is better explained by conceptualizing reproduction within unions as a joint venture, in which men's contributions are not simply lumped onto women's invariant levels of parental investment, but one in which men's involvement allows wives to reduce their own allocations to parental investment and increase those to fertility (fertility model), thereby maximizing the production of the union, not simply child survivorship.},

They also exhibit substantial variability among individuals in traits such as size, age, condition, and disease status that have large impacts on individual fates and consequently on the future of the population. We present here methods for constructing and analyzing a stochastic integral projection model (IPM) incorporating both of these forms of variability, illustrated through a case study of the monocarpic thistle Carlina vulgaris. We show how model construction can exploit the close correspondence between stochastic IPMs and statistical analysis of trait–fate relationships in a “mixed” or “hierarchical” models framework. This correspondence means that IPMs can be parameterized straightforwardly from data using established statistical techniques and software (vs. the largely ad hoc methods for stochastic matrix models), properly accounting for sampling error and between-year sample size ...},

This included redirection of the scholarly focus of the discipline, especially on the role evolutionary theory and "levels of selection", and increased visibility of ecologist as public figures in the environmental movement with special knowledge of how natural systems work. Cornell ecologist LaMont Cole is an important figure to examine both of these trends. Like many of his contemporaries, Cole was devoted to a perspective on natural selection operating at levels above the individual. However, because of his influential mathematical treatment of animal demography he has been historically subsumed into a group of scholars that views the events in the life course as adaptations to the maximization of individual fitness--life history theory. Cole's popular writings and lectures, which consumed his later career, extend his scholarly portrayal of natural populations as tending toward stable and homoeostatic equilibrium, with the goal of drawing contrasts with the deviance of rapid human population growth. In both regards, Cole serves as a topical and temporal extension of the well-documented and analyzed ecology of his mentors--Alfred Emerson, Thomas Park, and Warder Allee--in the University of Chicago Zoology Department.},

It is now apparent that this article is as important as his better-known 1964 articles on kin selection. Not only did the 1966 article explain aging, it also supplied the basic scaling forces for natural selection over the entire life history. Like the Lorentz transformations of relativistic physics, Hamilton's Forces of Natural Selection provide an overarching framework for understanding the power of natural selection at early ages, the existence of aging, the timing of aging, the cessation of aging, and the timing of the cessation of aging. His twin Forces show that natural selection shapes survival and fecundity in different ways, so their evolution can be somewhat distinct. Hamilton's Forces also define the context in which genetic variation is shaped. The Forces of Natural Selection are readily manipulable using experimental evolution, allowing the deceleration or acceleration of aging, and the shifting of the transition ages between development, aging, and late life. For these reasons, evolutionary research on the demographic features of life history should be referred to as "Hamiltonian."},

abstract = {1. In many noncooperative vertebrates, maternal effects commonly influence offspring survival and development. In cooperative vertebrates, where multiple adults help to raise young from a single brood, social effects may reduce or replace maternal effects on offspring. 2. Factors affecting offspring survival and development at different stages (fledging, nutritional independence and adulthood) were tested in the cooperatively breeding Arabian babbler to determine the relative importance of social, maternal and environmental factors at each stage. An influence of maternal effects was found during the nestling stage only. 3. Social factors affected the survival and development of young at all stages. The amount of food received from helpers influenced post-fledging weight gain, development of foraging skills, and survival to reproductive age. Environmental effects were also important, with groups occupying high-quality territories more likely to produce young that survived to maturity. 4. The strong influence of helper contributions on the survival and development of young at all stages from hatching to maturity suggests social factors may have important long-term effects on offspring fitness in cooperative societies. Traditional measures of offspring survival in cooperative birds, which commonly measure survival to fledging age only, may underestimate the significant benefit of helper contributions on the survival and development of young.},

abstract = {Great apes, our closest living relatives, live longer and mature later than most other mammals and modern humans are even later-maturing and potentially longer-lived. Evolutionary life-history theory seeks to explain cross-species differences in these variables and the covariation between them. That provides the foundation for a hypothesis that a novel role for grandmothers underlies the shift from an ape-like ancestral pattern to one more like our own in the first widely successful members of genus Homo. This hypothesis links four distinctive features of human life histories: 1). our potential longevity, 2). our late maturity, 3). our midlife menopause, and 4). our early weaning with next offspring produced before the previous infant can feed itself. I discuss the problem, then, using modern humans and chimpanzees to represent, respectively, genus Homo and australopithecines, I focus on two corollaries of this grandmother hypothesis: 1). that ancestral age-specific fertility declines persisted in our genus, while 2). senescence in other aspects of physiological performance slowed down. The data are scanty but they illustrate similarities in age-specific fertility decline and differences in somatic durability that are consistent with the hypothesis that increased longevity in our genus is a legacy of the "reproductive" role of ancestral grandmothers.},

We show that this effect evaporates as among-sibling dominance increases to the point where the allocation of resources is maximally unequal. We restore a kin-competition effect on emigration rates from dominance-ranked family groups by showing that where siblings form queues to inherit the breeding positions, the length of the queue affects the fitness of all individuals by depreciating the rank of subsequent offspring. Incorporating this 'offspring depreciation' effect decreases optimal queue lengths, increases dispersal rates and explains the otherwise paradoxical use of sinks by cooperatively breeding birds in stable environments. The offspring depreciation effect also favours the evolution of small, but consistent, clutch sizes and high reproductive skew, but constrains the evolution of alloparenting.},

@article{Kaar1998,
abstract = {Lifetime reproductive success and timing of reproduction are key components of life-history evolution. To understand the evolution of reproductive schedules, it is important to use a measure of fitness that is sensitive both to reproductive quantity and reproductive timing. There is a contradiction between the theory, which mainly focuses on the rate measures of fitness (r and lambda), and empirical studies, which mainly use lifetime reproductive success (LRS), or some of its correlates, as a fitness measure. We measured phenotypic selection on age-specific fertilities in three pre-modern human populations using individually estimated finite rate of increase, er (lambda). We found that lambda and lifetime reproductive success ranked individuals differently according to their fitness: for example, a female giving birth to four children at a young age may actually have a higher fitness than a female giving birth to six children at a greater age. Increase in fertility at the young age classes (15-19 years) was favoured by selection, but the intensity of selection on fertility was higher in the older age classes (20-30 years), where the variance in fertility was highest. Hence, variation in fertility in the older age classes (20-30) was actually responsible for most of the observed variation in fitness among the individuals. Additionally, more than 90{\%} of variation in fitness (lambda) was attributable to individual differences in LRS, whereas only about 5{\%} of all variation in fitness was due to differences in the reproductive schedule. The rate-sensitive fitness measure did not significantly challenge the importance of total fertility as a component of fitness in humans. However, the rate-sensitive measure clearly allowed more accurate estimation of individual fitness, which may be important for answering some more specific questions.},

But selection pressures may vary, so that short generation times experience less selection if selection is proportional to exposure x time. Long generation times may experience such strong selection that there are hardly any survivors; thus intermediate generation times may be expected to evolve resistance faster. This turns out to be the case for a sample of insects; intermediate generation times had evolved resistance to more chemicals than short or long generation times. HOWEVER: there might be constant {\%} mortality, and then the r would affect things. Low r leads to generally negative population growth in both resistant and susceptible forms; hi r leads to positive growth in both forms, intermediate forms have high selection because the resistants have positive growth, and the susceptibles have negative growth. -- The Mallet and Luttrell explanation},

Comparisons with previously developed approximate methods for haploid age-structured models show close, but not exact, agreement. A diploid population with both clonal and sexual reproduction is considered; examples from published demographic studies are used to show the effects of within-individual versus between-individual coalescence times and different definitions of generation time in calculating effective population size. These examples show relatively small differences in effective population sizes calculated using within- and between-individual coalescence times; however, in one case, different definitions of generation time lead to a large change in ratios of effective population size to census size (Ne/N). The Ne/N calculated for clonally reproducing organisms in this paper seem to be substantially smaller than published values for organisms lacking clonal reproduction.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In contrast to effects of PGMs, we discovered conditional differences in the MGM's effects between landless people and wealthier, commercial farmers. Our data indicate that the presence of the MGM only lowers the woman's age at marriage (AAM) and her age at the birth of her first child (AFB) in the case of landless families. However, among commercial farmers, who can generally be characterized by a lower AAM and AFB, we found opposite tendencies for the MGM's effect leading to a relatively small delay in AAM and AFB. Moreover, we also analyzed differences in the completed fertility (i.e., children ever born: CEB). Results indicate that landless families in general do have fewer CEB compared with commercial farmers except for those families in which the MGM has been present. Emphasizing that the adaptiveness of investment decisions should depend on the interaction of genetic, lineage-specific (intrinsic) and ecologically imposed (extrinsic) constraints, we conclude that kin strategies consequently address different fitness components under different conditions.},

The effect of fathers is of particular theoretical interest, as there has been considerable debate concerning the importance of fathers in the evolution of our species and of our reproductive strategies involving long-term pair bonds and biparental care. A common strategy for investigating the impact that parents have on child outcomes is to compare children raised in households without a mother or father to those raised in households with both parents. There is question, however, as to what degree any such effects are simply the result of covarying mortality hazards within families or through time and not necessarily a direct impact of parental absence.

abstract = {Human fathers are heavily involved in the rearing of children around the world. Early evolutionary explanations focused on the greater need of human children and mothers compared to other species and the consequent increased benefits available to investing fathers and pair-bonded husbands. Contrary to this hypothesis, research suggests that the impact of men's care on the survivorship and physical well-being of juvenile offspring is cross-culturally variable and often unsubstantial. Proper testing of the hypothesis, however, also requires exploring how well children raised with paternal investment fare as adults, compared to those raised in the absence of fathers. We explore this issue among the Tsimane, who exhibit high levels of paternal provisioning and very low divorce rates, by testing the impact of early father death on five measures of adult success: completed height, body mass index (BMI), age of first reproduction, completed fertility for age and number of surviving offspring for age. Of these five tests, a significant effect in the predicted direction was found only for body mass index of adult daughters. Therefore, there is no substantial evidence that Tsimane fathers have a large impact on the success of adult children. We explore alternative explanations for the high levels of paternal involvement and low divorce rates observed among the Tsimane, including the positive effects of men's investments on couple fertility and the constraints imposed by female preferences and the availability of alternative partners. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This article decomposes total population momentum into two constituent and multiplicative parts: "nonstable" momentum and "stable" momentum. Nonstable momentum depends on deviations between a population's current age distribution and its implied stable age distribution. Stable momentum is a function of deviations between a population's implied stable and stationary age distributions. In general, the factorization of total momentum into the product of nonstable and stable momentum is a very good approximation. The factorization is exact, however, when the current age distribution is stable or when observed fertility is already at replacement. We provide numerical illustrations by calculating nonstable, stable, and total momentum for 176 countries, the world, and its major regions. In short, the article brings together disparate strands of the population momentum literature and shows how the various kinds of momentum fit together into a single unifying framework.},

abstract = {When wealth is heritable, parents may manipulate family size to optimize the trade-off between more relatively poor offspring and fewer relatively rich ones, and channel less care into offspring that compete with siblings. These hypotheses were tested with quantitative ethnographic data collected among the Karo Batak--patrilineal agriculturalists from North Sumatra, Indonesia, among whom land is bequeathed equally to sons. It was predicted that landholding would moderate the relationship between reproductive rate and parental investment on one hand, and the number of same-sex siblings on the other, among boys but not girls. The predicted interaction effect was observed in interbirth intervals and immunizations, but only a trace of the effect was detected in age-five mortality. The study raises questions about the coevolution of human behavior and social structure. Adapted from the source document.},

abstract = {1. There is a growing number of empirical reports of environmental change simultaneously influencing population dynamics, life history and quantitative characters. We do not have a well-developed understanding of links between the dynamics of these quantities. 2. Insight into the joint dynamics of populations, quantitative characters and life history can be gained by deriving a model that allows the calculation of fundamental quantities that underpin population ecology, evolutionary biology and life history. The parameterization and analysis of such a model for a specific system can be used to predict how a population will respond to environmental change. 3. Age-stage-structured models can be constructed from character-demography associations that describe age-specific relationships between the character and: (i) survival; (ii) fertility; (iii) ontogenetic development of the character among survivors; and (iv) the distribution of reproductive allocation. 4. These models can be used to calculate a wide range of useful biological quantities including population growth and structure; terms in the Price equation including selection differentials; estimates of biometric heritabilities; and life history descriptors including generation time. We showcase the method through parameterization of a model using data from a well-studied population of Soay sheep Ovis aries. 5. Perturbation analysis is used to investigate how the quantities listed in summary point 4 change as each parameter in each character-demography function is altered. 6. A wide range of joint dynamics of life history, quantitative characters and population growth can be generated in response to changes in different character-demography associations; we argue this explains the diversity of observations on the consequences of environmental change from studies of free-living populations. 7. The approach we describe has the potential to explain within and between species patterns in quantitative characters, life history and population dynamics.},

In infinite populations, a standard method of calculating relatedness coefficients is through coefficients of consanguinity using the notion of genetic identity by descent. In this paper, we show that this approach can also be made to work in finite populations and we assume here that the population has a homogeneous structure, such as an island model. We demonstrate that, under the assumption that genetic effects are small and additive, the resulting formulation of inclusive fitness is equivalent to other significant measures of selection in finite populations, including the change in average allele frequency and fixation probability.

This research utilizes characteristics of dental morphology to trace genetic relationships among WA, western Europeans (EU), AA, and European Americans. Dental morphological traits are useful for this purpose because they are heritable, do not remodel during life (although they can be lost to wear or pathology), and can be compared equally among samples from past and present populations. The results of this research provide new information about human microevolution through time and space in a biocultural setting. The mean measure of divergence is used to analyze dental morphological data from 1,265 individuals in 25 samples grouped by ancestry and time. Three hypotheses associated with admixture in AA are tested. When compared with known history, results from dental morphological data are equivocal in documenting admixture in AA. Dental morphological traits do appear to reflect admixture in AA. However, changes in trait frequencies do not closely correspond with important cultural events and trends such as the institutionalized racism of the Civil War and Jim Crow era. Results are mixed concerning whether AA with greater admixture were more likely to take part in the Great Migration to southern urban centers and to the North.},

Here we generalize the Moran effect to include also nonlinear density regulation with spatial heterogeneity in local population dynamics as well as in the effects of environmental covariates by deriving a simple expression for the correlation between the sizes of two populations, using diffusion approximation to the theta-logistic model. In general, spatial variation in parameters describing the dynamics reduces population synchrony. We also show that the contribution of a covariate to spatial synchrony depends strongly on spatial heterogeneity in the covariate or in its effect on local dynamics. These analyses show exactly how spatial environmental covariation can synchronize fluctuations of spatially segregated populations with no interchange of individuals even if the dynamics are nonlinear.},

abstract = {1. A central question in population ecology is how to estimate the effects of common environmental noise, e.g. due to large-scale climate patterns, on the synchrony in population fluctuations over large distances. We show how the environmental variance can be split into components generated by several environmental variables and how these can be estimated from time-series observations. 2. With a set of time-series observations from different locations not necessarily covering the same time span, it is shown how the spatial autocorrelation of the residual variance component, not explained by the covariates and corrected for demographic stochasticity, can be estimated using classical multinormal theory. 3. Some previous results on spatial scaling in continuous linearized models on log scale are extended to also provide the scaling for the residuals. This is shown to be close to the spatial scaling of the autocorrelation in the environmental noise and only weakly affected by migration. 4. The logistic model of local population dynamics with the NAO index as the only covariate is fitted to 22 populations of the Continental great cormorant  Phalacrorax carbo sinensis . The spatial scale of the environmental noise is estimated to be about 155 km. The NAO index alone accounts for about 10{\%} of the total environmental variance and nearly all of the regional environmental variance (long-distance environmental autocorrelation).},

Kindreds had little effect on fitness independently of lineage charac- teristics. Fitness increased with the number of lineal relatives residing in the com- munity but decreased beyond an apparently optimal lineage size, suggesting resource enhancement and competition among kin. Female-biased patrilineage sex ratio was positively associated with men's fitness, while male-biased matrilineage sex ratio was positively associated with women's fitness. Number of brothers in the commu- nity was negatively associated with men's, but not women's, fitness. Parents and number of sisters had no effect on either male or female reproduction; however, women with younger sisters had higher RS, suggesting benefits of kin support for childcare. In sum, imposed norms for lineage social organization may enhance lineal ancestors' inclusive fitness at a cost to individual inclusive fitness.},

I also test whether relatedness is associated with health and schooling outcomes. The results are consistent with an inclusive fitness model: Households invest more in children who are more closely related. Two exceptions were found: in rural areas, genetic relatedness was negatively associated with money spent on food and on health care. Explanations for these results are discussed.},

abstract = {Following the seminal publications of Rubin about thirty years ago, statisticians have become increasingly aware of the inadequacy of “complete-case” analysis of datasets with missing observations. In medicine, for example, observa- tionsmay be missing in a sporadic way for different covariates, and a complete-case analysis may omit as many as half of the available cases. Hotdeck imputation was implemented in Stata in 1999 by Mander and Clayton. However, this technique may perform poorly when many rows of data have at least one missing value. This article describes an implementation for Stata of the MICE method of multiple multivariate imputation described by van Buuren, Boshuizen, and Knook (1999). MICE stands for multivariate imputation by chained equations. The basic idea of data analysis with multiple imputation is to create a small number (e.g., 5–10) of copies of the data, each of which has the missing values suitably imputed, and analyze each complete dataset independently. Estimates of parameters of inter- est are averaged across the copies to give a single estimate. Standard errors are computed according to the “Rubin rules”, devised to allow for the between- and within-imputation components of variation in the parameter estimates. This arti- cle describes five ado-files. mvis creates multiple multivariate imputations. uvis imputes missing values for a single variable as a function of several covariates, each with complete data. micombine fits a wide variety of regression models to a mul- tiply imputed dataset, combining the estimates using Rubin's rules, and supports survival analysis models (stcox and streg), categorical data models, generalized linear models, and more. Finally, misplit and mijoin are utilities to intercon- vert datasets created by mvis and by the miset program from John Carlin and colleagues. The use of the routines is illustrated with an example of prognostic modeling in breast cancer},

We derive an analytical measure which takes in account all consequences of the discrete nature of deme size. Expressions of this measure are detailed for infinite island models of population structure. As an illustration we consider the evolution of dispersal in populations made of small demes with environmental and demographic stochasticity. We confirm some results obtained from the analysis of models based on deterministic approximations. In particular, when there is an Allee effect, we show that evolution of the dispersal rate may lead the metapopulation to extinction. Thus, selection on the dispersal rate could restrict the distribution of species subject to Allee effects. This selection-driven extinction is prevented by kin selection when the environmental extinction rate is small. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {On the basis of church register entries from the Krummh{\"{o}}rn region (Ostfriesland, Germany, 1720–1874) we looked at whether the existence of grandmothers had an impact on the reproductive success of a family. We found that fertility measured by parity progression ratios was influenced by grandmothers, though only in exceptionally large families, while fertility measured by intervals between births was not influenced by grandmothers. However, maternal grandmothers reduced infant mortality when the children were between 6 and 12 months of age. During these 6 months, the relative risk of dying was approximately 1.8 times higher if the maternal grandmother was dead at the time of the child's birth compared to if she was alive. Interestingly, the existence of paternal grandmothers approximately doubled the relative risk of infant mortality during the 1st month of life. We interpret this as being the result of a tense relationship between mother- and daughter-in-laws. We found that Krummh{\"{o}}rn grandmothers could be both helpful and a hindrance at the same time. Geographic proximity increased the effects found. If this ambivalent impact of grandmothers on familial reproduction could be generalized beyond the Krummh{\"{o}}rn population, the hypothesis that the evolution of the postgenerative life span could be explained by grandmotherly kin-effects would have to be stated more precisely: the costs of social stress in the male descendency would have to be subtracted from the benefits of aid and assistance in the female descendency.},

abstract = {Interspecific mutualisms have been playing a central role in the functioning of all ecosystems since the early history of life. Yet the theory of coevolution of mutualists is virtually nonexistent, by contrast with well-developed coevolutionary theories of competition, predator-prey and host-parasite interactions. This has prevented resolution of a basic puzzle posed by mutualisms: their persistence in spite of apparent evolutionary instability. The selective advantage of 'cheating', that is, reaping mutualistic benefits while providing fewer commodities to the partner species, is commonly believed to erode a mutualistic interaction, leading to its dissolution or reciprocal extinction. However, recent empirical findings indicate that stable associations of mutualists and cheaters have existed over long evolutionary periods. Here, we show that asymmetrical competition within species for the commodities offered by mutualistic partners provides a simple and testable ecological mechanism that can account for the long-term persistence of mutualisms. Cheating, in effect, establishes a background against which better mutualists can display any competitive superiority. This can lead to the coexistence and divergence of mutualist and cheater phenotypes, as well as to the coexistence of ecologically similar, but unrelated mutualists and cheaters.},

In addition, we introduce a more easily calculated quantity Rm that relates to fitness in the same manner as R0 relates to fitness in ordinary population dynamics: the Rm of a mutant is only defined when the resident population dynamics converges to a point equilibrium and Rm is larger (smaller) than 1 if and only if mutant fitness is positive (negative). Rm corresponds to the average number of newborn dispersers resulting from the (on average less than one) local colony founded by a newborn disperser. Efficient algorithms for calculating its numerical value are provided. As an example of the usefulness of these concepts we calculate the evolutionarily stable conditional dispersal strategy for individuals that can account for the local population density in their dispersal decisions. Below a threshold density x, at which staying and leaving are equality profitable, everybody should stay and above x everybody should leave, where profitability is measured as the mean number of dispersers produced through lines of descent consisting of non-dispersers.},

abstract = {We examine the effect of iteroparity on the evolution of dispersal for a species living in a stable but fragmented habitat. We use a kin selection model that incorporates the effects of demographic stochasticity on the local age structure and age-specific genetic identities. We consider two cases: when the juvenile dispersal rate is allowed to change with maternal age and when it is not. In the latter case, we find that the unconditional evolutionarily stable dispersal rate increases when the adult survival rate increases. Two antagonistic forces act upon the evolution of age-specific dispersal rates. First, when the local age structure varies between patches of habitat, the intensity of competition between adults and juveniles in the natal patch is, on average, lower for offspring born to older senescent mothers. This selects for decreasing dispersal with maternal age. Second, offspring born to older parents are on average more related to other juveniles in the same patch and they experience a higher intensity of kin competition, which selects for increasing dispersal with maternal age. We show that the evolutionary outcome results from a balance between these two opposing forces, which depends on the amount of variance in age structure among sub-populations.},

Furthermore, the usual arguments underlying the definition of game-theoretical measures of inclusive fitness are not exact under localized dispersal. We define such measures to give the first-order effects of selection on the probability of fixation of an allele. The derived measures of kin selection and relatedness are valid in finite populations and under localized dispersal. For the infinite island model, the resulting measure of kin selection is equivalent to a previously used measure. In other cases its definition is based on definitions of relatedness which are different from the usual ones. To illustrate the approach, we reanalyse a model with localized dispersal. We consider sex ratio evolution under sex-specific dispersal behaviour, and the results confirm the earlier conclusion that the sex ratio is biased towards the sex with the dispersal rate closer to the optimal dispersal rate in the absence of sex-specific dispersal behaviour.},

@article{Hurtado1992,
abstract = {Even though female food acquisition is an area of considerable interest in hunter-gatherer research, the ecological determinants of women's economic decisions in these populations are still poorly understood. The literature on female foraging behavior indicates that there is considerable variation within and across foraging societies in the amount of time that women spend foraging and in the amount and types of food that they acquire. It is possible that this heterogeneity reflects variation in the trade-offs between time spent in food acquisition and child care activities that women face in different groups of hunter-gatherers. In this paper we discuss the fitness trade-offs between food acquisition and child care that Hiwi and Ache women foragers might face. Multiple regression analyses show that in both populations the daily food acquisition of a woman's spouse is negatively related to female foraging effort. In addition, nursing mothers spend less time foraging and acquire less food than do nonnursing women. As the number of dependents that a woman has increases, however, women also increase foraging time and the amount of food they acquire. Some interesting exceptions to these general trends are as follows: (a) differences in foraging effort between nursing and nonnursing women are less pronounced when fruits and roots are in season than in other seasons of the year; (b) foraging return rates decrease for Ache women as their numbers of dependents increase; and (c) among Ache women, the positive effect of number of dependents on foraging behavior is less pronounced when fruits are in season than at other times of the year. Lastly, in the Hiwi sample we found that postreproductive women work considerably harder than women of reproductive age in the root season but not in other seasons of the year. We discuss how ecological variation in constraints, the number of health insults to children that Hiwi and Ache mothers can avoid, and the fitness benefits they can gain from spending time in food acquisition and child care might account for differences and similarities in the foraging behaviors of subgroups of Hiwi and Ache mothers across different seasons of the year. Valid tests of the explanations we propose will require considerable effort to measure the relationship between maternal food acquisition, child care, and adverse health outcomes in offspring.},

@article{Peacock1991,
abstract = {Pregnancy is thought to be a metabolically very expensive endeavor, yet investigations have produced inconsistent results concerning the responsiveness of human birth weight to maternal nutritional stress or nutritional intervention. These findings have led some researchers to conclude that fetal growth is strongly buffered against fluctuations in maternal energy balance, making the fetus in effect a "nearly perfect parasite." This buffering would appear to be a reasonable adaptive response given the high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with low birth weight. However, a life-history approach leads to the prediction that maternal investment strategies in pregnancy should be geared toward maximizing lifetime reproductive success rather than simply the success of the current pregnancy, and by extension that maternal investment strategies should vary with reproductive value. The physiology of human pregnancy in fact appears to include a number of mechanisms that protect maternal energy resources from diversion to the fetus and preserve them for future reproductive events. These mechanisms include adjustment of blood flow to the uterus and perhaps minor adjustments in gestation length, although evidence for the latter is scant. Suggestions are made for ways of investigating these maternal options.},

abstract = {When population geneticists wish to determine the genetic consequences of some aspect of mating behavior, it is often necessary to compare observed levels of consanguinity to the level expected when mating is random with respect to the factor being studied. Expectations under random mating are often derived from discrete generation models that ignore age structure. Observed frequencies of consanguineous matings are due to processes that are continuous in time and are affected by variables that are functions of age structure. The extent to which this discrepancy between the models and reality might distort conclusions drawn from comparisons of observed and expected behavior has received insufficient attention. One potential source of error is the tendency for people to choose mates whose ages differ from their own by a certain amount; this tendency influences the frequency of consanguineous matings. Age correlation between mates should therefore also affect average consanguinity between mates and average inbreeding in the population. Expected levels of consanguinity might then differ depending on whether or not age structure has been taken into account. Hajnal developed a model that predicts the frequencies of consanguineous matings in age-structured populations. Hajnal's model is extended here to include relationships that are defined by lineal descent as well as by common ancestry, and to allow calculation of the frequencies of consanguineous matings in the absence of age correlation between mates. The extended model is then used to determine the effect of age correlation between mates on average consanguinity under various sets of conditions. The magnitude of this effect depends on the degree to which the increased frequency of some types of consanguineous matings is offset by the decrease in other types of matings. There is a fairly wide range of conditions under which this compensation is nearly complete and therefore under which the overall effect of age correlation is small. But the size of this effect is sensitive to many factors, especially the distribution of age differences between mates and the variances of ages at maternity and paternity. Under some conditions, age correlation between mates will have a substantial effect on average consanguinity.},

abstract = {It is well established that individuals age differently. Yet the nature of these inter-individual differences is still largely unknown. For humans, two main hypotheses have been recently formulated: individuals may experience differences in aging rate or aging timing. This issue is central because it directly influences predictions for human lifespan and provides strong insights into the biological determinants of aging. In this article, we propose a model which lets population heterogeneity emerge from an evolutionary algorithm. We find that whether individuals differ in (i) aging rate or (ii) timing leads to different emerging population heterogeneity. Yet, in both cases, the same mortality patterns are observed at the population level. These patterns qualitatively reproduce those of yeasts, flies, worms and humans. Such findings, supported by an extensive parameter exploration, suggest that mortality patterns across species and their potential shapes belong to a limited and robust set of possible curves. In addition, we use our model to shed light on the notion of subpopulations, link population heterogeneity with the experimental results of stress induction experiments and provide predictions about the expected mortality patterns. As biology is moving towards the study of the distribution of individual-based measures, the model and framework we propose here paves the way for evolutionary interpretations of empirical and experimental data linking the individual level to the population level.},

abstract = {Although bubonic plague is an endemic zoonosis in many countries around the world, the factors responsible for the persistence of this highly virulent disease remain poorly known. Classically, the endemic persistence of plague is suspected to be due to the coexistence of plague resistant and plague susceptible rodents in natural foci, and/or to a metapopulation structure of reservoirs. Here, we test separately the effect of each of these factors on the long-term persistence of plague. We analyse the dynamics and equilibria of a model of plague propagation, consistent with plague ecology in Madagascar, a major focus where this disease is endemic since the 1920s in central highlands. By combining deterministic and stochastic analyses of this model, and including sensitivity analyses, we show that (i) endemicity is favoured by intermediate host population sizes, (ii) in large host populations, the presence of resistant rats is sufficient to explain long-term persistence of plague, and (iii) the metapopulation structure of susceptible host populations alone can also account for plague endemicity, thanks to both subdivision and the subsequent reduction in the size of subpopulations, and extinction-recolonization dynamics of the disease. In the light of these results, we suggest scenarios to explain the localized presence of plague in Madagascar.},

abstract = {In a previous theoretical study we investigated whether adaptive or non-adaptive processes are more important in the evolution of senescence. We built a model that combined both processes and found that mutation accumulation is important only at those ages where mortality has a negligible impact on fitness. This model, however, was limited to haploid organisms. Here we extend our model by introducing diploidy and sexual reproduction. We assume that only recessive (mutated) homozygotes experience detrimental effects. Our results corroborate our previous conclusions, confirming that life histories are largely determined by adaptive processes. We also found that the equilibrium frequencies of mutated alleles are at higher values than in haploid model, because mutations in heterozygotes are hidden for directional selection. Nevertheless, the equilibrium frequencies of recessive homozygotes that make mutations visible to selection are very similar to the equilibrium frequencies of these alleles in our haploid model. Diploidy and sexual reproduction with recombination slows down approaching selection-mutation balance.},

abstract = {The classic anthropological hypothesis known as the "obstetrical dilemma" is a well-known explanation for human altriciality, a condition that has significant implications for human social and behavioral evolution. The hypothesis holds that antagonistic selection for a large neonatal brain and a narrow, bipedal-adapted birth canal poses a problem for childbirth; the hominin "solution" is to truncate gestation, resulting in an altricial neonate. This explanation for human altriciality based on pelvic constraints persists despite data linking human life history to that of other species. Here, we present evidence that challenges the importance of pelvic morphology and mechanics in the evolution of human gestation and altriciality. Instead, our analyses suggest that limits to maternal metabolism are the primary constraints on human gestation length and fetal growth. Although pelvic remodeling and encephalization during hominin evolution contributed to the present parturitional difficulty, there is little evidence that pelvic constraints have altered the timing of birth.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: While the ultimate causes of most species extinctions are environmental, environmental constraints have various secondary consequences on evolutionary and ecological processes. The roles of demographic, genetic mechanisms and their interactions in limiting the viabilities of species or populations have stirred much debate and remain difficult to evaluate in the absence of demography-genetics conceptual and technical framework. Here, I computed projected times to metapopulation extinction using (1) a model focusing on the effects of species properties, habitat quality, quantity and temporal variability on the time to demographic extinction; (2) a genetic model focusing on the dynamics of the drift and inbreeding loads under the same species and habitat constraints; (3) a demo-genetic model accounting for demographic-genetic processes and feedbacks.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Results indicate that a given population may have a high demographic, but low genetic viability or vice versa; and whether genetic or demographic aspects will be the most limiting to overall viability depends on the constraints faced by the species (e.g., reduction of habitat quantity or quality). As a consequence, depending on metapopulation or species characteristics, incorporating genetic considerations to demographically-based viability assessments may either moderately or severely reduce the persistence time. On the other hand, purely genetically-based estimates of species viability may either underestimate (by neglecting demo-genetic interactions) or overestimate (by neglecting the demographic resilience) true viability.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Unbiased assessments of the viabilities of species may only be obtained by identifying and considering the most limiting processes (i.e., demography or genetics), or, preferentially, by integrating them.},

The particles move independently according to a Markov process and when a branching event occurs, the offspring locations depend on the position of the mother and the number of offspring. We prove a law of large numbers for the empirical measure of individuals alive at time t. This relies on a probabilistic interpretation of its intensity by mean of an auxiliary process. The latter has the same generator as the Markov process along the branches plus additional jumps, associated with branching events of accelerated rate and biased distribution. This comes from the fact that choosing an individual uniformly at time t favors lineages with more branching events and larger offspring number. The central limit theorem is considered on a special case. Several examples are developed, including applications to splitting diffusions, cellular aging, branching L{\'{e}}vy processes.},

First, they operate at individual level rather than use aggregate data; second, they produce re-sults based on repeat random experiments rather than producing average indicators. During the 1990s, many microsimulation models have been developed in OECD countries in order to study population changes and the demographic and economic consequences of specific policy meas-ures, not only at the aggregate levels but also at the individual level and for subgroups of the population. The main models which simulate individual behaviour are Standard microsimula-tion models (MSMs) and Agent based models (ABMs). The logic of both types of dynamic in-dividual simulation models is presented and some micromodels used in social sciences are de-scribed. Based on a literature review and this description of existing population microsimulation models, concrete proposals are made for the SustainCity demographic module.},

abstract = {Environmental stochasticity and density-dependence can have critical synergetic effects on population dynamics, especially when dealing with threatened species. In this study, we examine the effects of these interactions on the dynamics of a vulnerable bird species, the Dalmatian pelican (Pelicanus crispus). We conducted demographic analysis and population dynamics modelling of the Amvrakikos pelican population (western Greece) based on a 20-y dataset. Results indicated that annual juvenile survival probability is low (mean = 0.65) and varies according to both negative (regulation) and positive (Allee effect) density-dependent processes. In contrast, adult survival is relatively high (mean = 0.95) and less variable. Deterministic and stochastic population dynamics models based on means, inter-annual variances, and covariances between vital rates revealed that the population is increasing deterministically. Simulations of the extinction risk for the study population and also for various population sizes revealed that short-term extinction risk remains extremely low, even for very small populations of the species. However, when we considered the possibility of rare catastrophic events and their interactions with density-dependence patterns, the projected extinction risk increased dramatically, especially for small populations. Given that many European Dalmatian pelican populations are small, most of them could be at risk for local extinction. Our results illustrate the critical and general importance of considering interactions between all potential factors of extinction in population viability assessments.},

abstract = {A variable environment leaves a signature in a population's dynamics. Deriving statistical and mathematical models of how environmental variability affects population projections has - in the wake of reports of substantial climatic fluctuations - received much recent attention. If the model changes, then so too does the population projection. This is because a different model of environmental variability changes estimates of long-run stochastic growth, which is a function of demographic rates and their temporal sequence. Decomposing elasticities of long-run stochastic growth into constituent parts can assess the relative influence of different components. Here, we investigate the consequences of changing the environmental state definition, and therefore altering the shape of demographic rate distributions and their temporal sequence, by using age-structured matrix models to project vertebrate populations into the future under a range of environmental scenarios. The identity of the most influential demographic rate was consistent among all approaches that perturbed only the mean, but was not when only the variance was perturbed. Furthermore, the influence of each demographic rate fluctuated among projections by up to factors of six and two for changes to the variance and mean, respectively. These changes in influence depend in part upon how environmental variability - in particular, the color of environmental noise - is incorporated. In the light of predictions of increasing climatic variability in the future, these results suggest caution when drawing quantitative conclusions from stochastic population projections. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Little is known about the effects of inbreeding on reproduction in modern human societies. It appears indeed that biological effects are hidden by socioeconomic factors, which are the major determinants of fertility. It has been established, in particular, that socially induced reproductive compensation tends to homogenize the number of offspring per family in a given population. Besides, in the field of evolutionary biology, a number of empirical and theoretical studies have shown that the effects of inbreeding are condition dependent. In particular, theoretical developments on the evolution of senescence predict that the deleterious effects of inbreeding should increase with age. We rely on these developments to examine the effects of inbreeding on fertility in a cohort of Canadian women born in the late 19th century. The analysis does not allow for the detection of any effect of inbreeding on the overall number of offspring of women. However, results indicate that high levels of close father inbreeding are associated with a reduction of the productivity of parents during the second half of their reproductive period, as compared with the first half. We suggest that inbreeding depression affects reproduction in modern societies through an interaction with age.},

abstract = {A branching process in random environment {\$}(Z{\_}n, n \backslashin \backslashN){\$} is a generalization of Galton Watson processes where at each generation the reproduction law is picked randomly. In this paper we give several results which belong to the class of {\{}$\backslash$it large deviations{\}}. By contrast to the Galton-Watson case, here random environments and the branching process can conspire to achieve atypical events such as {\$}Z{\_}n \backslashle e{\^{}}{\{}cn{\}}{\$} when {\$}c{\$} is smaller than the typical geometric growth rate {\$}\backslashbar L{\$} and {\$} Z{\_}n \backslashge e{\^{}}{\{}cn{\}}{\$} when {\$}c {\textgreater} \backslashbar L{\$}. One way to obtain such an atypical rate of growth is to have a typical realization of the branching process in an atypical sequence of environments. This gives us a general lower bound for the rate of decrease of their probability. When each individual leaves at least one offspring in the next generation almost surely, we compute the exact rate function of these events and we show that conditionally on the large deviation event, the trajectory {\$}t \backslashmapsto \backslashfrac1n \backslashlog Z{\_}{\{}[nt]{\}}, t\backslashin [0,1]{\$} converges to a deterministic function {\$}f{\_}c :[0,1] \backslashmapsto \backslashR{\_}+{\$} in probability in the sense of the uniform norm. The most interesting case is when {\$}c {\textless} \backslashbar L{\$} and we authorize individuals to have only one offspring in the next generation.

abstract = {The success of reintroduction programs greatly depends on the amount of mortality and dispersal of the released individuals. Although local environmental pressures are likely to play an important role in these processes, they have rarely been investigated because of the lack of spatial replicates of reintroduction. In the present study, we analyzed a 25-year data set encompassing 272 individuals released in five reintroduction programs of Griffon Vultures (Gyps fulvus) in France to examine the respective roles of survival and dispersal in program successes and failures. We use recent developments in multi-strata capture-recapture models to take into account tag loss in survival estimates and to consider and estimate dispersal among release areas. We also examined the effects of sex, age, time, area, and release status on survival, and we tested whether dispersal patterns among release areas were consistent with habitat selection theories. Results indicated that the survival of released adults was reduced during the first year after release, with no difference between sexes. Taking into account local observations only, we found that early survival rates varied across sites. However when we distinguished dispersal from mortality, early survival rates became equal across release sites. It thus appears that among reintroduction programs difference in failure and success was due to differential dispersal among release sites. We revealed asymmetrical patterns of dispersal due to conspecific attraction: dispersers selected the closest and the largest population. We showed that mortality can be homogeneous from one program to another while, on the contrary, dispersal is highly dependent on the matrix of established populations. Dispersal behavior is thus of major interest for metapopulation restoration and should be taken into account in planning reintroduction designs.},

abstract = {Among the factors proximally involved in the extinction of small isolated populations, genetic deterioration and temporal variation in environmental quality have been the subjects of intensive research in ecological and evolutionary sciences. However, previous theoretical studies and population viability assessments generally assumed a strict dichotomy between these two types of threat. Yet a number of empirical studies have recently suggested that the effects of genetic deterioration and environmental variation should not be considered independently, by demonstrating that the main effect of inbreeding depression lies with its tendency to exacerbate the deleterious consequences of environmental stress. Capitalizing on these results, I developed a stochastic model to examine the impact of random environmental perturbations on the persistence time of small isolated populations subject to inbreeding depression and mutation accumulation. The model assumes that spontaneous deleterious mutations have more severe effects when perturbations occur, which results in more efficient purging of the mutation load. Under this assumption, I find that negative perturbations may paradoxically improve middle- and long-term species persistence for realistic frequency of occurrence and severity distribution.},

abstract = {Relatedness estimators are widely used in genetic studies, but effects of population structure on performance of estimators, criteria to evaluate estimators, and benefits of using such estimators in conservation programs have to date received little attention. In this article we present new estimators, based on the relationship between coancestry and molecular similarity between individuals, and compare them with existing estimators using Monte Carlo simulation of populations, either panmictic or structured. Estimators were evaluated using statistical criteria and a diversity criterion that minimized relatedness. Results show that ranking of estimators depends on the population structure. An existing estimator based on two-gene and four-gene coefficients of identity performs best in panmictic populations, whereas a new estimator based on coancestry performs best in structured populations. The number of marker alleles and loci did not affect ranking of estimators. Statistical criteria were insufficient to evaluate estimators for their use in conservation programs. The regression coefficient of pedigree relatedness on estimated relatedness (beta2) was substantially lower than unity for all estimators, causing overestimation of the diversity conserved. A simple correction to achieve beta2 = 1 improves both existing and new estimators. Using relatedness estimates with correction considerably increased diversity in structured populations, but did not do so or even decreased diversity in panmictic populations.},

abstract = {Despite strong empirical evidence of the harmful effects of inbreeding on fecundity, spontaneous recessive deleterious mutations are generally considered as acting on survival only in evolutionary models and population viability analyses. In this study, we modelled a species with separate sexes to assess the effect of selection on fecundity in small populations on the risk of extinction. We showed that the impact of inbreeding on short-term fitness changes and that population dynamics are strongly influenced by phenotypic interactions among males and females during reproduction. In particular, population persistence was found to be highly sensitive to the level at which selection acts (i.e. individual vs. pair) and to asymmetry among sexes (in terms of mutation rates and mutational effects). c 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 86, 467-476},

Links between early menarche and other markers of reproductive strategy were investigated. Childhood stress and absence of a father figure, whether genetically related or not, were found to have accelerated menarche whereas having younger siblings decelerated it. Early menarche was associated with attractiveness ratings, the number of partners desired for the immediate future, and the early onset of intimate relationships. It was not linked with sociosexual orientation, mate choice criteria, and investment in the subjects' own children, but these three markers were interrelated. The implications of the findings for the four evolutionary models are discussed.},

Major themes emerging include the role of modern statistical techniques in bringing together experimental and theoretical studies, the importance of long-term experimentation and the need for ecology to have model systems, and the value of population growth rate as a means of understanding and predicting population change. The last point is illustrated by the application of a recently introduced technique, integral projection modelling, to study the population growth rate of a monocarpic perennial plant, its elasticities to different life-history components and the evolution of an evolutionarily stable strategy size at flowering.},

Developments in statistical time-series analysis on the one hand and in capture-recapture statistical modelling on the other hand, now allow for improved analyses. We review some of the recent developments in the capture-recapture statistical methodology - restricting ourselves to methods most relevant to the demography of small mammals. A 5-years study of the gray- sided vole Clethrionomys rufocanus in Hokkaido, Japan was used as an example to explore some models. We then provided a framework for further demographic analysis of microtine populations, including C. rufocanus. Investigating the relative importance of the different demographic parameters (e.g. survival, maturation, dispersal) will require studies done on larger scale than is commonly done today, with more effort devoted to the low density phase. Special emphasis is given to study-design, and to experimental designs tailored to the study of specific demographic mechanisms.},

abstract = {In a constant environment, the rate of convergence of a density-independent Leslie matrix model to stable age distribution is determined by the damping ratio (the ratio of the absolute magnitudes of the first and second eigenvalues of the projection matrix). In a stochastic environment, the difference between the first two Lyapunov exponents is known to be analogous to the logarithm of the damping ratio, but there has been no systematic investigation of the consequences of enviromnental variation on convergence rates. In this study, the Lyapunov spectrum has been calculated for a wide variety of density-independent projection matrices subject to random variations in vital rates. This allows the impact of these random variations on convergence rates to be assessed. For rapidly convergent life histories, stochastic variation leads to a decrease in convergence rate. For life histories which are slow to converge, stochastic variation speeds up convergence. These effects are, however, relatively minor, and the value of the damping ratio for the mean matrix is a good predictor of the damping ratio in a stochastic environment. Consequently, when only an approximate indication of convergence rates is needed, the damping ratio for the mean projection matrix gives a very good guide. Detailed calculations of the Lyapunov spectrum would only be necessary to make comparisons between similar life histories or if very precise information on convergence rates were needed.},

abstract = {Kin selection arguments, based on Hamilton's (1964) concept of inclusive fitness, provide a powerful heuristic and can therefore give us valuable insights into the different pathways through which natural selection acts. But their formulation can be quite tricky, requiring as they do, a close accounting of all the fitness effects of a particular item of behaviour. Here we propose a "direct fitness" formulation of inclusive fitness which often has a more straightforward derivation. Our method finds ESS trait values by the standard optimization techniques of simple differentiation plus two additional steps. First, slopes of group phenotype on individual genotype arise naturally during differentiation, and these slopes are replaced by coefficients of relatedness. Second, when behaviours influence different classes such as age, sex of recipient, or other life history components of fitness, the fitness effects on each component are weighted by reproductive value. We illustrate this technique first in a homogeneous population, with examples of group competition and partial dispersal behaviour, and then in a class-structured population, with examples of sex allocation and altruism between age classes.},

The results explain previously puzzling features of life cycle delays observed in nature, predicting that populations of the same species living in environments of differing harshness can display different life history phenotypes, a number of distinct life history phenotypes can coexist neutrally within a single population, and genetic polymorphisms are easily maintained if heterozygotes have intermediate life history phenotypes.},

The model explicitly postulates two steps in the process: an encounter between individuals available for mating, and the end of the encounter in mating or not mating depending on the individual mating preferences. Two types of encounters, "individual" and "mass" encounters, are introduced, and the restrictions imposed by previously formed pairs on the availability of individuals for future matings are discussed. It is demonstrated that not only the mating preferences of individuals but also the type of encounters between individuals affect the distribution of characters in mating pairs (mating pattern of the population). It is also shown that the mating pattern of a population is not a direct reflection of the individual mating preferences; for example, panmixia does not necessarily mean that individuals do not have mating preferences, and positive (negative) assortment in mating pairs does not necessarily indicate homotypic (heterotypic) mating preferences. The importance of distinguishing between the pattern of mating preferences and the mating pattern of a population is emphasized. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1988 The University of Chicago},

abstract = {Discrete stage-structured density-dependent and discrete age-structured density-dependent population models are considered. Regarding the former, we prove that the model at hand is permanent (i.e., that the population will neither go extinct nor exhibit explosive oscillations) and given density dependent fecundity terms we also show that species with delayed semelparous life histories tend to be more stable than species which possess precocious semelparous life histories. Moreover, our findings together with results obtained from other stage-structured models seem to illustrate a fairly general ecological principle, namely that iteroparous species are more stable than semelparous species. Our analysis of various age-structured models does not necessarily support the conclusions above. In fact, species with precocious life histories now appear to possess better stability properties than species with delayed life histories, especially in the iteroparous case. We also show that there are dynamical outcomes from semelparous age-structured models which we are not able to capture in corresponding stage-structured cases. Finally, both age- and stage-structured population models may generate periodic dynamics of low period (either exact or approximate). The important prerequisite is to assume density-dependent survival probabilities.},

The definition is based on the familiar method of studying a periodic map by means of its (period-length) composite. This composite has an additive decomposition that permits a generalization of the Cushing-Zhou definition of R (0) in the autonomous case. The value of R (0) determines whether the population goes extinct (R (0){\textless}1) or persists (R (0){\textgreater}1). We discuss the biological interpretation of this definition and derive formulas for R (0) for two cases: scalar periodic maps of arbitrary period and periodic Leslie models of period 2. We illustrate the use of the definition by means of several examples and by applications to case studies found in the literature. We also make some comparisons of this definition of R (0) with another definition given recently by Baca{\"{e}}r.},

@article{Bodin2012,
abstract = {There are concerns that anthropogenic harvesting may cause phenotypic adaptive changes in exploited wild populations, in particular maturation at a smaller size and younger age. In this paper, we study the evolutionarily stable size at maturation of prey subjected to size-selective harvesting in a simple predator-prey model, taking into account three recognized life-history costs of early maturation, namely reduced fecundity, reduced growth, and increased mortality. Our analysis shows that harvesting large individuals favors maturation at smaller size compared to the unharvested system, independent of life-history tradeoff and the predator's prey-size preference. In general, however, the evolutionarily stable maturation size can either increase or decrease relative to the unharvested system, depending on the harvesting regime, the life-history tradeoff, and the predator's preferred size of prey. Furthermore, we examine how the predator population size changes in response to adaptive change in size at maturation of the prey. Surprisingly, in some situations, we find that the evolutionarily stable maturation size under harvesting is associated with an increased predator population size. This occurs, in particular, when early maturation trades off with growth rate. In total, we determine the evolutionarily stable size at maturation and associated predator population size for a total of forty-five different combinations of tradeoff, harvest regime, and predated size class.},

abstract = {The ability to characterise capillary supply plays a key role in developing effective therapeutic interventions for numerous pathological conditions, such as capillary loss in skeletal or cardiac muscle. However, quantifying capillary supply is fraught with difficulties. Averaged measures such as capillary density or mean inter-capillary distance cannot account for the local geometry of the underlying capillary distribution, and thus can only highlight a tissue wide, global hypoxia. Detailed tissue geometry, such as muscle fibre size, has been incorporated into indices of capillary supply by considering the distribution of Voronoi tessellations generated from capillary locations in a plane perpendicular to muscle fibre orientation, implicitly assuming that each Voronoi polygon represents the area of supply of its enclosed capillary. Using a modelling framework to assess the capillary supply capacity under maximal sustainable conditions in muscle, we theoretically demonstrate that Voronoi tessellations often provide an accurate representation of the regions supplied by each capillary. However, we highlight that this use of Voronoi tessellations is inappropriate and inaccurate in the presence of extensive capillary rarefaction and pathological variations in oxygen tension of different capillaries. In such cases, oxygen flux trapping regions are developed to provide a more general representation of the capillary supply regions, in particular incorporating the additional influences of heterogeneity that are absent in the consideration of Voronoi tessellations.},

We identify 13.4 million variants, substantially increasing the set of known human variation. We found evidence of archaic introgression in all three populations, and the distribution of time to most recent common ancestors from these regions is similar to that observed for introgressed regions in Europeans. Additionally, we identify numerous loci that harbor signatures of local adaptation, including genes involved in immunity, metabolism, olfactory and taste perception, reproduction, and wound healing. Within the Pygmy population, we identify multiple highly differentiated loci that play a role in growth and anterior pituitary function and are associated with height.},

abstract = {The question of how dispersal behavior is adaptive and how it responds to changes in selection pressure is more relevant than ever, as anthropogenic habitat alteration and climate change accelerate around the world. In metapopulation models where local populations are large, and thus local population size is measured in densities, density-dependent dispersal is expected to evolve to a single-threshold strategy, in which individuals stay in patches with local population density smaller than a threshold value and move immediately away from patches with local population density larger than the threshold. Fragmentation tends to convert continuous populations into metapopulations and also to decrease local population sizes. Therefore we analyze a metapopulation model, where each patch can support only a relatively small local population and thus experience demographic stochasticity. We investigated the evolution of density-dependent dispersal, emigration and immigration, in two scenarios: adult and natal dispersal. We show that density-dependent emigration can also evolve to a nonmonotone, "triple-threshold" strategy. This interesting phenomenon results from an interplay between the direct and indirect benefits of dispersal and the costs of dispersal. We also found that, compared to juveniles, dispersing adults may benefit more from density-dependent vs. density-independent dispersal strategies.},

@article{Kachel2011,
abstract = {Humans are unique among primates in that women regularly outlive their reproductive period by decades. The grandmother hypothesis proposes that natural selection increased the length of the human post-menopausal period-and, thus, extended longevity-as a result of the inclusive fitness benefits of grandmothering. However, it has yet to be demonstrated that the inclusive fitness benefits associated with grandmothering are large enough to warrant this explanation. Here, we show that the inclusive fitness benefits are too small to affect the evolution of longevity under a wide range of conditions in simulated populations. This is due in large part to the relatively weak selection that applies to women near or beyond the end of their reproductive period. However, we find that grandmothers can facilitate the evolution of a shorter reproductive period when their help decreases the weaning age of their matrilineal grandchildren. Because selection favours a shorter reproductive period in the presence of shorter interbirth intervals, this finding holds true for any form of allocare that helps mothers resume cycling more quickly. We conclude that while grandmothering is unlikely to explain human-like longevity, allocare could have played an important role in shaping other unique aspects of human life history, such as a later age at first birth and a shorter female reproductive period.},

Infections cause most mortality in wild chimpanzees and in traditional forager-farmers with limited access to modern medicine. Although we know little of the diseases of aging under premodern conditions, in captivity, chimpanzees present a lower incidence of cancer, ischemic heart disease, and neurodegeneration than current human populations. These major differences in pathology of aging are discussed in terms of genes that mediate infection, inflammation, and nutrition.

This article shows that this variation can be explained in terms of evolutionary entropy, a statistical parameter which characterizes the robustness of a population, and describes the uncertainty in the age of the mother of a randomly chosen newborn. We show that entropy also has a macroscopic description: It is linearly related to the logarithm of the variables body size, metabolic rate, and life span. Furthermore, entropy characterizes Darwinian fitness, the efficiency with which a population acquires and converts resources into viable offspring. Accordingly, entropy predicts the outcome of natural selection in populations subject to different classes of ecological constraints. This predictive property, when integrated with the macroscopic representation of entropy, is the basis for enormous differences in morphometric and life-history parameters across species.},

These changes culminate in menopause, conventionally defined as a cessation of menstrual cycles that marks the end of reproductive capacity. In fact, a central and defining event in menopause is the discontinuation of ovulation, which is correlated with a number of structural and functional changes in the reproductive axis. Despite several decades of research, a degree of uncertainty remains as to whether nonhuman primates undergo menopause, and whether they are suitable models of human reproductive senescence. We review some of the controversies that have clouded our understanding of reproductive aging in nonhuman primates, including issues of definition, timing, comparability of data from wild versus captive populations, and cross-species comparisons. The existing data support the view that menopause occurs in a number of primate species and is not unique to humans.},

Process variation, which can be both demographic and environmental, is modeled by linking a series of stochastic and deterministic subprocesses that characterize processes such as birth, survival, maturation, and movement. Observations of the population can be modeled as functions of true abundance with realistic probability distributions to describe observation or estimation error. Computer-intensive procedures, such as sequential Monte Carlo methods or Markov chain Monte Carlo, condition on the observed data to yield estimates of both the underlying true population abundances and the unknown population dynamics parameters.

Because the development of poikilothermic organisms depends directly on the temperature of their habitat, environmental variability is also an integral factor in models of their phenology. In this paper we present two existing phenology models, the distributed delay model and the Sharpe and DeMichele model, and develop an alternate approach, called the Extended von Foerster model, based on the age-structured McKendrick-von Foerster partial differential model. We compare the models theoretically by examining the biological assumptions made in the basic derivation of each approach. In particular, we focus on each model's ability to incorporate variability among individuals as well as variability in the environment. When compared against constant temperature mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) laboratory developmental data, the Extended von Foerster model exhibits the highest correlation between theory and observation. ?? 2004 Society for Mathematical Biology.

abstract = {Demographic analyses of age-structured populations typically rely on life history data for individuals, or when individual animals are not identified, on information about the numbers of individuals in each age class through time. While it is usually difficult to determine the age class of a randomly encountered individual, it is often the case that the individual can be readily and reliably assigned to one of a set of age classes. For example, it is often possible to distinguish first-year from older birds. In such cases, the population age structure can be regarded as a latent variable governed by a process prior, and the data as summaries of this latent, structure. In this article, we consider the problem of uncovering the latent structure and estimating process parameters from summaries of age class information. We present a demographic analysis for the critically endangered migratory population of whooping cranes (Grus americana), based only on counts of first-year birds and of older birds. We estimate age and year-specific survival rates. We address the controversial issue of whether management action on the breeding grounds has influenced recruitment, relating recruitment rates to the number of seventh-year and older birds, and examining the pattern of variation through time in this rate},

abstract = {Virulence is an evolutionary paradox because parasites never benefit from their host's death. The adaptive explanation of virulence is classically based upon the existence of physiological constraints that create a trade-off between parasites' epidemiological traits (virulence, transmissibility, and clearance). Here we develop an epidemiological model where infections are dynamic processes and we demonstrate how these dynamics generate a trade-off between emerging epidemiological parameters. We then study how host's immune strength modifies this trade-off and hence influences virulence evolution. We found that in acute infections, where parasites are engaged in a race with immune cells, immunity restrains more the duration of the infection than its intensity. As a consequence parasites evolve to provoke more virulent but shorter infections in strongly immunized hosts.},

The dependence on the resources is introduced through the death rates of the reproductive age classes. The conditions assumed in the derivation of the model are regularity and plausible limiting behaviors of the functions in the model. It is shown that the model dynamics restricted to its omega-limit sets is a diffeomorphism of a compact set, and the period-1 fixed points of the model are structurally stable. The loss of stability of the non-zero steady state occurs by a discrete Hopf bifurcation. Under general conditions, and after the loss of stability of the structurally stable steady states, the time evolution of population numbers is periodic or quasi-periodic. Numerical analysis with prototype functions has been performed, and the conditions leading to chaotic behavior in time are discussed.},

abstract = {We compare two modes of 'escape in time' from an unpredictable environment: developmental delay ('stay young') such as seed dormancy, and reproductive delay ('age gracefully') such as delayed flowering. We find that developmental delay and reproductive delay are symmetric with respect to fitness i.e. they have the same effect on growth rate if they have equal costs, and if the environmental pattern is time-reversible. We describe this property by saying that if one kind of delay is an 'escape into the future', the other is an 'escape into the past'. When the costs of the two kinds of delay are equal, and we add a little delay to a life cycle that has none, the increase in growth rate is equal whether we add developmental delay, reproductive delay, or a combination of' the two. When the costs of delay are equal, and we consider a life cycle that has just one form of delay, the largest gain in fitness tends to come from an increase in the delay that is already present. Thus, changes in the amount of delay tend to be self-reinforcing. Hence we expect evolution to lead to an entrainment so that life cycles will often contain mainly one or other kind of delay. As the amount of delay increases, the growth rate reaches a maximum that may be regarded as an ESS, and then falls. Geometrically, this maximum is a 'ridge' on the fitness surface when environments are moderately variable i.e. there are many combinations of delays that yield the maximum growth rate. When the environment becomes highly variable, or strongly positively autocorrelated, this 'ridge' is replaced by a pair of 'peaks'. Two combinations of delay then lead to the highest growth rate, one where reproductive delay is dominant and one where developmental delay is dominant. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Density-independent and density-dependent, stochastic and deterministic, discrete-time, structured models are formulated, analysed and numerically simulated. A special case of the deterministic, density-independent, structured model is the well-known Leslie age-structured model. The stochastic, density-independent model is a multitype branching process. A review of linear, density-independent models is given first, then nonlinear, density-dependent models are discussed. In the linear, density-independent structured models, transitions between states are independent of time and state. Population extinction is determined by the dominant eigenvalue lambda of the transition matrix. If lambda {\textless} or = 1, then extinction occurs with probability one in the stochastic and deterministic models. However, if lambda {\textgreater} 1, then the deterministic model has exponential growth, but in the stochastic model there is a positive probability of extinction which depends on the fixed point of the system of probability generating functions. The linear, density-independent, stochastic model is generalized to a nonlinear, density-dependent one. The dependence on state is in terms of a weighted total population size. It is shown for small initial population sizes that the density-dependent, stochastic model can be approximated by the density-independent, stochastic model and thus, the extinction behavior exhibited by the linear model occurs in the nonlinear model. In the deterministic models there is a unique stable equilibrium. Given the population does not go extinct, it is shown that the stochastic model has a quasi-stationary distribution with mean close to the stable equilibrium, provided the population size is sufficiently large. For small values of the population size, complete extinction can be observed in the simulations. However, the persistence time increases rapidly with the population size.},

The model was applied to simulate introductions of white-tailed deer into an area; the fitted model predicted a carrying capacity of 215 deer, which was close to the observed carrying capacity of 220 deer. The rate of population increase depends on the dominant eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix, and the age structure of the simulated population approaches a stable age distribution at the carrying capacity, which was similar to that generated by the Leslie matrix. The logistic equation has been applied to study many phenomena, and the matrix model can be applied to these same processes. For example, random variation can be added to life history parameters, and population abundances generated with random effects on fecundity show both the affect of annual variation in fecundity and a longer-term pattern resulting from the age structure.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the age pattern of mortality observed in a set of study populations is most likely an evolution in conjunction with fertility history. The proposed model allows for populations which have both early reproduction and short life and later reproduction and long life. The covariation of fertility and mortality is a product of long-term selection on the correlated fitness components of mortality and fertility. The models illustrate that reproductive timing is a consequence of the joint evolution of fertility and mortality. The proposed models are an expression of classical theory of senescence within an evolutionary framework proposed in studies by Medawar, Williams, and Hamilton. The present examination widens the application of the theory. This study questions where the location of the high mortality ages should be, and discusses how a time scale in a life history is determined by evolution. The model of "fitness" is based on the writings of Tujapurkar and Charlesworth. The assumption is that genotypes are "invading" ones. Phenotypic genetic processes are determined by one locus in a randomly mating population of large size. In the population there is one resident phenotype and one fixed genotype. The new phenotype at the locus is a heterozygote between the new and the resident allele. The "fitness" measures "r" and "a" allow for the invasion of the new allele. Respecification of the model occurs with changes in density dependence. The theory stipulates that mortality does not contribute to fitness beyond a particular point. Gavrilov and Gavrilova models are suggestive of this study's reliability models of mortality},

abstract = {We analyze a stage-structured model of a population that displays variable diapause in a randomly varying environment. The ruggedness of the environment is measured by the extent of random variation in per-capita reproductive success. We show how variable diapause and environmental characteristics affect the population's stochastic growth rate. In rugged unpredictable environments, phenotypes that show some tendency to diapause are found to have a higher growth rate than nondiapausing phenotypes. In harsh rugged environments, some tendency to diapause may be all that permits population persistence. Positive serial autocorrelation causes the optimal diapause fraction to decrease, while negative autocorrelation causes that fraction to increase. The structured model behaves very differently from a scalar model for large diapause fractions even in uncorrelated environments, and in many cases predicts a broad optimum. The difference between models is due to the extreme variability of stage structure in populations subject to even small variability when diapause tendency is high.},

abstract = {The following notes provide an introduction to recent work of Branner, Hubbard and Yoccoz on the geometry of polynomial Julia sets. They are an expanded version of lectures given in Stony Brook in Spring 1992. I am indebted to help from the audience. Section 1 describes unpublished work by J.-C. Yoccoz on local connectivity of quadratic Julia sets. It presents only the "easy" part of his work, in the sense that it considers only non-renormalizable polynomials, and makes no effort to describe the much more difficult arguments which are needed to deal with local connectivity in parameter space. It is based on second hand sources, namely Hubbard together with lectures by Branner and Douady. Hence the presentation is surely quite different from that of Yoccoz. Section 2 describes the analogous arguments used by Branner and Hubbard to study higher degree polynomials for which all but one of the critical orbits escape to infinity. In this case, the associated Julia set J is never locally connected. The basic problem is rather to decide when J is totally disconnected. This Branner-Hubbard work came before Yoccoz, and its technical details are not as difficult. However, in these notes their work is presented simply as another application of the same geometric ideas. Chapter 3 complements the Yoccoz results by describing a family of examples, due to Douady and Hubbard (unpublished), showing that an infinitely renormalizable quadratic polynomial may have non-locally-connected Julia set. An Appendix describes needed tools from complex analysis, including the Gr"otzsch inequality.},

The paper extends arguments used by Maynard Smith {\&} Price (1973) showing that ritualized behaviour can evolve by individual selection. The concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy, or ESS, is defined. Two types of ritualized contests are distinguished, “tournaments” and “displays”; the latter, defined as contests without physical contact in which victory goes to the contestant which continues longer, are analyzed in detail. Three main conclusions are drawn. The degree of persistence should be very variable, either between individuals or for the same individual at different times; a negative exponential distribution of persistence times is predicted. Individuals should display with constant intensity, independent of how much longer they will in fact continue. An initial asymmetry in the conditions of a contest can be used to settle it, even if it is irrelevant to the outcome of a more protracted conflict if one were to take place.},

Gompertz's work played an important role in shaping the emerging statistical science that underpins the pricing of life insurance and annuities. Latterly, as the subject of ageing itself became the focus of scientific study, the Gompertz model provided a powerful stimulus to examine the patterns of death across the life course not only in humans but also in a wide range of other organisms. The idea that the Gompertz model might constitute a fundamental 'law of mortality' has given way to the recognition that other patterns exist, not only across the species range but also in advanced old age. Nevertheless, Gompertz's way of representing the function expressive of the pattern of much of adult mortality retains considerable relevance for studying the factors that influence the intrinsic biology of ageing. This commentary was written to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.},

A genotype moulds its phenotype's age patterns of mortality and fertility in an environment; these two patterns in turn determine the genotype's fitness in that environment. Hence, to understand the evolution of ageing, age patterns of mortality and reproduction need to be compared for species across the tree of life. However, few studies have done so and only for a limited range of taxa. Here we contrast standardized patterns over age for 11 mammals, 12 other vertebrates, 10 invertebrates, 12 vascular plants and a green alga. Although it has been predicted that evolution should inevitably lead to increasing mortality and declining fertility with age after maturity, there is great variation among these species, including increasing, constant, decreasing, humped and bowed trajectories for both long- and short-lived species. This diversity challenges theoreticians to develop broader perspectives on the evolution of ageing and empiricists to study the demography of more species.},

abstract = {In some vertebrates, offspring help their parents produce additional offspring. Often individuals of one sex are more likely to become "helpers at the nest". We analyze how such sex-biased offspring helping can influence sex-ratio evolution. It is essential to account for age-structure because the sex ratios of early broods influence how much help is available for later broods; previous authors have not correctly accounted for this fact. When each female produces the same sex ratio in all broods (as assumed in all previous analyses of sex-biased helping), the optimal investment strategy is biased towards the more-helpful sex. When a female has facultative control over the sex ratio in each brood and each helper of a given sex increases the resource available for offspring production by a fixed amount, the optimal strategy is to produce only the more-helpful sex in early broods and only the less-helpful sex in later broods. When there are nonlinear returns from helping, i.e., each helper increases the amount of resource available for reproduction by an amount dependent upon the number of helpers, the optimal strategy is to maximize resource accrual from helping in early broods (which may involve the production of both sexes) and then switch to the exclusive production of the less-helpful sex in later broods. The population sex ratio is biased towards the more-helpful sex regardless of whether the sex ratio is fixed or age-dependent. When fitness returns from helping exhibit environmental patchiness, females are selected to produce only males on some patches and only females on others, and the population sex ratio may be biased in either direction. We discuss our results in light of empirical information on offspring helping, and we show via meta-analysis that there is no support for the claim of Griffin et al. [Griffin,A.S., Sheldon,B.C., West,S.A., 2005. Cooperative breeders adjust offspring sex ratios to produce helpful helpers. Amer. Nat. 166, 628-632] that parents produce more of the helpful sex when that sex is rare or absent. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Language documentation often takes place in contexts of heavy language contact, where there is a shift in progress from a minority language to another culturally dominant lan- guage. For many younger speakers, the language of their parents is increasingly acquired as a second language, and their communication in this second language shows classic transfer effects, where transfer is “[a] general cover term for a number of different kinds of influence from languages other than the target language” on a learner's acquisition of that target language (Ellis 1994:341). However, transfer can also been seen as a more pervasive phenomenon, “a constraint imposed by previous knowledge on a more general process, that of inferencing” (Schachter 1992:44). Considered in this light, transfer can influence far more than a given learner's interlanguage. Assumptions, attitudes, and conceptual models associated with a culturally dominant language can all unconsciously influence assump- tions made about minority languages. These can, in turn, affect various strategic decisions made in the documentation of such languages, including whether a given variety should be documented, which speakers should be recorded, which text types to collect, what orthog- raphy to use, even what constitutes a genuine feature of the lexis, phonology, morphology, and so on. This paper aims primarily to illustrate this phenomenon, and to explore ways of dealing with it. Dominant language influence needs to be taken into account at each stage of the documentation process, minimizing it where it is intrusive, and taking advantage of it where it can be of use.},

However, there is no theoretical framework to predict the complex and various effects of these constraints on ecological communities. We developed a dynamic model that mimics the use of different resource types by a community of competing species. We investigated the effects of different environmental constraints (affecting either directly the growth rate of species or having indirect effects on their resources) on several biodiversity indicators. Our results indicate that (i) in realistic community models (assuming uneven resource requirements among species) the effects of perturbations are strongly buffered compared to neutral models; (ii) the species richness of communities can be maximized for intermediate levels of direct constraints (unimodal response), even in the absence of trade-off between competitive ability and tolerance to constraints; (iii) no such unimodal response occurs with indirect constraints; (iv) an increase in the environmental (e.g., climatic) variance may have different effects on community biomass and species richness. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

This unique spatial pattern does not occur in the well-studied stored grain pests T. castaneum (Herbst) and T. confusum (Duval). We propose density dependent dispersal as a causal mechanism for this spatial pattern. We model and explore the spatial dynamics of T. brevicornis with a set of four density dependent integrodifference and difference equations.

abstract = {Genome-wide patterns of homozygosity runs and their variation across individuals provide a valuable and often untapped resource for studying human genetic diversity and evolutionary history. Using genotype data at 577,489 autosomal SNPs, we employed a likelihood-based approach to identify runs of homozygosity (ROH) in 1,839 individuals representing 64 worldwide populations, classifying them by length into three classes-short, intermediate, and long-with a model-based clustering algorithm. For each class, the number and total length of ROH per individual show considerable variation across individuals and populations. The total lengths of short and intermediate ROH per individual increase with the distance of a population from East Africa, in agreement with similar patterns previously observed for locus-wise homozygosity and linkage disequilibrium. By contrast, total lengths of long ROH show large interindividual variations that probably reflect recent inbreeding patterns, with higher values occurring more often in populations with known high frequencies of consanguineous unions. Across the genome, distributions of ROH are not uniform, and they have distinctive continental patterns. ROH frequencies across the genome are correlated with local genomic variables such as recombination rate, as well as with signals of recent positive selection. In addition, long ROH are more frequent in genomic regions harboring genes associated with autosomal-dominant diseases than in regions not implicated in Mendelian diseases. These results provide insight into the way in which homozygosity patterns are produced, and they generate baseline homozygosity patterns that can be used to aid homozygosity mapping of genes associated with recessive diseases.},

abstract = {Deleterious mutations tend to be recessive. Several theories, notably those of Fisher (based on selection) and Wright (based on metabolism), have been put forward to explain this pattern. Despite a long-lasting debate, the matter remains unresolved. This debate has focused on the average dominance of mutations. However, we also know very little about the distribution of dominance coefficients among mutations, and about its variation across environments. In this article we present a new approach to predicting this distribution. Our approach is based on a phenotypic fitness landscape model. First, we show that under a very broad range of conditions (and environments), the average dominance of mutation of small effects should be approximately one-quarter as long as adaptation of organisms to their environment can be well described by stabilizing selection on an arbitrary set of phenotypic traits. Second, the theory allows predicting the whole distribution of dominance coefficients among mutants. Because it provides quantitative rather than qualitative predictions, this theory can be directly compared to data. We found that its prediction on mean dominance (average dominance close to 0.25) agreed well with the data, based on a meta-analysis of dominance data for mildly deleterious mutations. However, a simple landscape model does not account for the dominance of mutations of large effects and we provide possible extension of the theory for this class of mutations. Because dominance is a central parameter for evolutionary theory, and because these predictions are quantitative, they set the stage for a wide range of applications and further empirical tests.},

abstract = {Population was the subject of two major conceptual developments in the second quarter of the 20(th) century. Both were inspired by evolutionary biology. Lotka developed a mathematics of evolution in human and other species by analogy to thermodynamic models. His theory followed demographic practice in treating populations as closed units, commonly macro-scale, and in inferring underlying processes of change from aggregate outcomes. In contrast, the evolutionary synthesis - a collaborative product of research in experimental and population genetics, natural history, and related fields of biology - followed Darwin in insisting that close observation of small-scale population processes and local environments is necessary to understand population change. Because gene-environment interactions rely on expanding and contracting networks of individuals, the populations in question are by nature open. Despite the apparent conflict between these positions, the synthesis broke new ground in the history of population thought by showing how the two approaches could be combined. Demography, however, moved away from evolutionary and population biology as a source of theory in the early post-war era, and this conceptual redevelopment of population was scarcely remarked upon. More recently, the tremendous development of genetics has recalled demographers' attention to evolutionary theory as an inescapable element of modern population thought. This paper provides a historical introduction to mid-20(th)-century developments in Darwinian population thinking, and the implications of its dual conceptualisation of population for demography. Its potential importance extends beyond the problem of gene-environment interactions to many aspects of social network analysis.},

abstract = {The distribution of the selection coefficients of beneficial mutations is pivotal to the study of the adaptive process, both at the organismal level (theories of adaptation) and at the gene level (molecular evolution). A now famous result of extreme value theory states that this distribution is an exponential, at least when considering a well-adapted wild type. However, this prediction could be inaccurate under selection for an optimum (because fitness effect distributions have a finite right tail in this case). In this article, we derive the distribution of beneficial mutation effects under a general model of stabilizing selection, with arbitrary selective and mutational covariance between a finite set of traits. We assume a well-adapted wild type, thus taking advantage of the robustness of tail behaviors, as in extreme value theory. We show that, under these general conditions, both beneficial mutation effects and fixed effects (mutations escaping drift loss) are beta distributed. In both cases, the parameters have explicit biological meaning and are empirically measurable; their variation through time can also be predicted. We retrieve the classic exponential distribution as a subcase of the beta when there are a moderate to large number of weakly correlated traits under selection. In this case too, we provide an explicit biological interpretation of the parameters of the distribution. We show by simulations that these conclusions are fairly robust to a lower adaptation of the wild type and discuss the relevance of our findings in the context of adaptation theories and experimental evolution.},

Physiological factors have the effects commonly expected. Maternal risk is increased by general economic and social conditions that are plausibly related to withdrawal of men's labour from family farming as a result of military mobilizations and growing levels of wage labour. Risk is decreased by membership in large patriarchal kin groups, but is increased by both the presence of classic rivals (husband's brothers' wives) and being married to a husband junior among his brothers. The analysis demonstrates the sensitivity of maternal survival to macrolevel changes in such factors as the collapse of feudalism, military involvement, economic stagnation, and monetization, as well as to microeconomic and micropolitical factors at the household and local kin-group level.},

abstract = {Common principal components (CPC) analysis is a technique for assessing whether variance-covariance matrices from different populations have similar structure. One potential application is to compare additive genetic variance-covariance matrices, G. In this article, the conditions under which G matrices are expected to have common PCs are derived for a two-locus, two-allele model and the model of constrained pleiotropy. The theory demonstrates that whether G matrices are expected to have common PCs is largely determined by whether pleiotropic effects have a modular organization. If two (or more) populations have modules and these modules have the same direction, the G matrices have a common PC, regardless of allele frequencies. In the absence of modules, common PCs exist only for very restricted combinations of allele frequencies. Together, these two results imply that, when populations are evolving, common PCs are expected only when the populations have modules in common. These results have two implications: (1) In general, G matrices will not have common PCs, and (2) when they do, these PCs indicate common modular organization. The interpretation of common PCs identified for estimates of G matrices is discussed in light of these results.},

Sensitivity analysis is an important way to quantify the effects of changes in these parameters on the behavior of the chain. Many properties of Markov chains can be written as simple matrix expressions, and hence matrix calculus is a powerful approach to sensitivity analysis. Using matrix calculus, we derive the sensitivity and elasticity of a variety of properties of absorbing and ergodic finite-state chains. For absorbing chains, we present the sensitivities of the moments of the number of visits to each transient state, the moments of the time to absorption, the mean number of states visited before absorption, the quasistationary distribution, and the probabilities of absorption in each of several absorbing states. For ergodic chains, we present the sensitivity of the stationary distribution, the mean first passage time matrix, the fundamental matrix, and the Kemeny constant.

Here, we apply matrix calculus to obtain the sensitivity and elasticity of scalar-, vector-, or matrix-valued output variables. We apply the method to linear models for periodic environments (including seasonal harvest models), to vec-permutation models in which individuals are classified by multiple criteria, and to nonlinear models including both immediate and delayed density dependence.

abstract = {Population dynamics often defy predictions based on empirical models, and explanations for noisy dynamics have ranged from deterministic chaos to environmental stochasticity. Transient (short-term) dynamics following disturbance or perturbation have recently gained empirical attention from researchers as further possible effectors of complicated dynamics. Previously published methods of transient analysis have tended to require knowledge of initial population structure. However, this has been overcome by the recent development of the parametric Kreiss bound (which describes how large a population must become before reaching its maximum possible transient amplification following a disturbance) and the extension of this and other transient indices to simultaneously describe both amplified and attenuated transient dynamics. We apply the Kreiss bound and other transient indices to a data base of matrix models from 108 plant species, in an attempt to detect ecological and mathematical patterns in the transient dynamical properties of plant populations. We describe how life history influences the transient dynamics of plant populations: species at opposite ends of the scale of ecological succession have the highest potential for transient amplification and attenuation, whereas species with intermediate life history complexity have the lowest potential. We find ecological relationships between transients and asymptotic dynamics: faster-growing populations tend to have greater potential magnitudes of transient amplification and attenuation, which could suggest that short- and long-term dynamics are similarly influenced by demographic parameters or vital rates. We describe a strong dependence of transient amplification and attenuation on matrix dimension: perhaps signifying a potentially worrying artefact of basic model parameterization. Synthesis. Transient indices describe how big or how small plant populations can get, en route to long-term stable rates of increase or decline. The patterns we found in the potential for transient dynamics, across many species of plants, suggest a combination of ecological and modelling strategy influences. This better understanding of transients should guide the formulation of management and conservation strategies for all plant populations that suffer disturbances away from stable equilibria. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Projection matrices have become the dominant modelling approach in plant demography because they (i) are relatively easy to formulate, (ii) compile complex data in a structured and analytically tractable manner, (iii) provide numerous parameters with direct biological meaning, (iv) allow the investigator to address broad or specific, experimental and/or theoretical, ecological and evolutionary questions, and (v) produce uniform outputs, enabling direct comparisons between the results of different studies. The last decade has witnessed major advancements in this field that have brought demographic models much closer to the real world, in particular in the analysis of effects of spatial and temporal environmental variation on populations. The present Special Feature contributes to that progress with novel methodologies and applications on Integral Projection Models, stochastic Life Table Response Experiment analyses, stochastic elasticities, transient dynamics and phylogenetic analyses. Synthesis. Environmental stochasticity is an integral part of ecosystems, and plant populations exhibit a tremendous array of demographic strategies to deal with its effects. The analytical challenge of understanding how populations avoid, tolerate or depend on stochasticity is finally overcome with the new matrix approaches. The tools are now available to interpret the effects of changes in temporal and spatial variation on plant populations. -� 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation -� 2010 British Ecological Society},

The transient states of the chain are life cycle stages (size classes, age classes, developmental stages, spatial locations, occupational categories, etc.). The absorbing states include death. Other absorbing states may be added. I show how to analyze longevity, competing risks, the net reproductive rate, the birth interval, and age at maturity directly from the Markov chain. Perturbation analysis of the fundamental matrix gives the sensitivity of demographic characteristics to changes in the vital rates. The model is extended to include spatial or temporal variation.

abstract = {Our systematic formulation of nonlinear population models is based on the notion of the environmental condition. The defining property of the environmental condition is that individuals are independent of one another (and hence equations are linear) when this condition is prescribed (in principle as an arbitrary function of time, but when focussing on steady states we shall restrict to constant functions). The steady-state problem has two components: (i) the environmental condition should be such that the existing populations do neither grow nor decline; (ii) a feedback consistency condition relating the environmental condition to the community/population size and composition should hold. In this paper we develop, justify and analyse basic formalism under the assumption that individuals can be born in only finitely many possible states and that the environmental condition is fully characterized by finitely many numbers. The theory is illustrated by many examples. In addition to various simple toy models introduced for explanation purposes, these include a detailed elaboration of a cannibalism model and a general treatment of how genetic and physiological structure should be combined in a single model. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {For populations with a density-dependent life history reproducing at discrete annual intervals, we analyze small or moderate fluctuations in population size around a stable equilibrium, which is applicable to many vertebrate populations. Using a life history having age at maturity alpha, with stochasticity and density dependence in adult recruitment and mortality, we derive a linearized autoregressive equation with time lags from 1 to alpha yr. Contrary to current interpretations, the coefficients corresponding to different time lags in the autoregressive dynamics are not simply measures of delayed density dependence but also depend on life-history parameters. The theory indicates that the total density dependence in a life history, D, should be defined as the negative elasticity of population growth rate per generation with respect to change in population size, [Formula: see text], where lambda is the asymptotic multiplicative growth rate per year, T is the generation time, and N is adult population size. The total density dependence in the life history, D, can be estimated from the sum of the autoregression coefficients. We estimate D in populations of seven vertebrate species for which life-history studies and unusually long time series of complete population censuses are available. Estimates of D were statistically significant and large, on the order of 1 or higher, indicating strong density dependence in five of the seven species. We also show that life history can explain the qualitative features of population autocorrelation functions and power spectra and observations of increasing empirical variance in population size with increasing length of time series.},

In many cases, especially when classes are defined by a continuous variable, such as length or mass, there are no natural breakpoints, and the division is artificial. We introduce the “integral projection model,” which eliminates the need for division into discrete classes, without requiring any additional biological assumptions. Like a traditional matrix model, the integral projection model provides estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, stable size distribution, reproductive values, and sensitivities of the growth rate to changes in vital rates. However, where the matrix model represents the size distributions, reproductive value, and sensitivities as step functions (constant within a stage class), the integral projection model yields smooth curves for each of these as a function of individual size.

abstract = {The concept of “fitness” is of undisputed importance to evolutionary biology, but there is as yet little unanimity among evolutionists as to how it should be defined formally. In consequence a variety of mathematical fitness measures are in current use, and it is unclear which, if any of them, should be regarded as fundamental. In this paper a number of popular fitness measures are surveyed and their claims as indices of fitness examined critically. It is found that most of them probably fail to quantify the property of fitness in any fundamental or universal sense. One measure, however, possesses logical properties which recommend it as possibly fundamental. It is expected time to extinction, sometimes also called “average extinction time” or “mean survival time”. The expected time to extinction of a population or genotype is intimately related to the probability of its occurrence in such a way as to ensure the validity of certain common inference patterns found in optimization, adaptationist, and similar types of evolutionary reasoning. Thus its application is more readily justified on logical grounds than would be the use of other more traditional measures of fitness. The traditional measures may, however, be sufficiently closely associated with expected time to extinction to justify their use under certain special conditions.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a technique for parameterizing Leslie transition matrices from simple age and sex population counts, using an implementation of "Wood's Method" [wood]; these matrices can forecast population by age and sex (the "cohort component" method) using simple matrix multiplication and a starting population. Our approach improves on previous methods for creating Leslie matrices in two respects: it eliminates the need to calculate input demographic rates from "raw" data, and our new format for the Leslie matrix more elegantly reveals the population's demographic components of change (fertility, mortality, and migration). The paper is organized around three main themes. First, we describe the underlying algorithm, "Wood's Method," which uses quadratic optimization to fit a transition matrix to age and sex population counts. Second, we use demographic theory to create constraint sets that make the algorithm useable for human populations. Finally, we use the method to forecast 3,120 US counties and show that it holds promise for automating cohort-component forecasts. This paper describes the first published successful application of Wood's method to human populations; it also points to more general promise of constrained optimization techniques in demographic modeling.},

abstract = {Estimates of age-specific fertility rates based on survey data are known to suffer down-bias associated with incomplete reporting. Previously, William Brass (1964, 1965, 1968) proposed a series of adjustments of such data to reflect more appropriate levels of fertility through comparison with data on children-ever-born by age, a measure of cohort-specific cumulative fertility. His now widely-used Parity/Fertility or PF ratio method makes a number of strong assumptions, which have been the focus of an extended discussion in the literature on indirect estimation. However, while it is clear that the measures used in making adjusted age-specific fertility estimates with this method are captured with statistical uncertainty, little discussion of the nature of this uncertainty around PF-ratio based estimates of fertility has been entertained in the literature. Since both age-specific risk of childbearing and cumulative parity (children ever born) are measured with statistical uncertainty, an unknown credibility interval must surround every PF ratio-based estimate. Using the standard approach, this is unknown, limiting the ability to make statistical comparisons of fertility between groups or to understand stochasticity in population dynamics. This paper makes use of approaches applied to similar problems in engineering, the natural sciences, and decision analysis--often discussed under the title of uncertainty analysis or stochastic modeling--to characterize this uncertainty and to present a new method for making PF ratio-based fertility estimates with 95 percent uncertainty intervals. The implications for demographic analysis, between-group comparisons of fertility, and the field of statistical demography are explored.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of kin on child survival in a matrilineal society in Malawi. Women usually live in close proximity to their matrilineal kin in this agricultural community, allowing opportunities for helping behavior between matrilineal relatives. However, there is little evidence that matrilineal kin are beneficial to children. On the contrary, child mortality rates appear to be higher in the presence of maternal grandmothers and maternal aunts. These effects are modified by the sex of child and resource ownership: female children and children in households where women, rather than men, own land suffer higher mortality rates in the presence of maternal kin. These modifiers suggest the detrimental effects of matrilineal kin may result from competition between such kin for resources. There are some positive effects of kin on child survival: the presence of elder siblings of both sexes is correlated with higher survival rates, and there is some weak evidence that paternal grandmothers may be beneficial to a child's survival chances. There is little evidence that any male kin, whether matrilineal or patrilineal, and including fathers, affect child mortality rates. This study highlights the importance of taking social and ecological context into account when investigating relationships between kin.},

abstract = {Cooperation is needed for evolution to construct new levels of organization. Genomes, cells, multicellular organisms, social insects, and human society are all based on cooperation. Cooperation means that selfish replicators forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one another. But natural selection implies competition and therefore opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism is at work. Here I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is derived that specifies whether natural selection can lead to cooperation.},

abstract = {We perform a theoretical study of effective pollen dispersal within plant populations exhibiting intraspecific spatial aggregation. We simulate nonuniform distributions of individuals by means of a Poisson cluster process and use an individual-based spatially explicit model of pollen dispersal to assess the effects of different aggregation patterns on the effective pollen pool size (N(ep)) and the axial variance of pollen dispersal (sigma (p)). Results show clear interactions between clumping and both N(ep) and sigma (p), whose precise form and intensity depend on the relative spatial scale of aggregation to pollen dispersal range. If clump size is small relative to dispersal range, clumping results in lower N(ep) and sigma (p) than in randomly distributed populations. Interestingly, by contrast, aggregation may actually enlarge N(ep) and has minimum impact on sigma (p) if clump size is near or above the scale of dispersal. High intraclump to global density ratios enhance the sensitivity of both N(ep) and sigma (p) to clumping, while leptokurtic pollen dispersal generates sharper reductions of both N(ep) and sigma (p) for small clump sizes and stronger increments of N(ep) for larger clump sizes. Overall, our results indicate that isolation-by-distance models in plants should not ignore the effects of intraspecific spatial aggregation on effective dispersal.},

@article{VanBavel2003,
abstract = {It has been demonstrated for many pre-industrial populations that the age at marriage, or marriage duration, influences age-specific marital fertility but the reason for this remains unclear. Among the several mechanisms that may be responsible, the following are often cited: secondary sterility or increased subfecundity associated with parity; declining coital frequency; the age difference between the spouses; and, importantly, parity-dependent fertility control. If the latter mechanism were partly responsible for the marriage-duration effect in pre-transition populations, it would contradict the concept of the modern fertility transition as the evolution (or revolution) from parity-independent to parity-dependent fertility. The study presented in this paper investigates the relative importance of these alternative explanations. The application of multivariate Poisson regression to the fertility data from two birth cohorts in the Belgian city of Leuven shows that a linearly declining or even concave age-specific fertility pattern, disaggregated by age at marriage, does not imply parity-dependent fertility limitation.},

We carried out large-scale demographic experiments to examine the direct effect of maternal age and paternal age on offspring aging in inbred and outbred strains of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We found that the age of mothers and, to a lesser extent, the age of fathers can have a large influence on both offspring longevity and the shape of the age-specific mortality trajectory. In two independent experiments we found that older mothers generally produced shorter-lived offspring, although the exact effect of maternal age on offspring longevity differed among strains.

We analyzed the effect of these processes on the irregular pattern of population crashes of Soay sheep on the St. Kilda archipelago, United Kingdom. Because the age and sex structure of the population fluctuates independently of population size, and because animals of different age and sex respond in different ways to density and weather, identical weather conditions can result in different dynamics in populations of equal size. In addition, the strength of density-dependent processes is a function of the distribution of weather events. Incorporating demographic heterogeneities into population models can influence dynamics and their response to climate change.},

abstract = {"Helpers at the nest," usually offspring of a preceding litter who contribute by feeding the young to increase the reproductive success of a breeding pair, are known in many species of birds and mammals. Although similar behaviors were described by ethnological observations in several human societies, there is a lack of data on their existence and role. This study of 794 reproductive life histories of post-menopausal Berber women of Southern Morocco aims to provide such information. Results show that the presence of "probable helpers" in the household is related to higher fertility scores and is associated with improved survival of offspring to sexual maturity. In contrast to sparse observations from other human societies, there is no indication that child caretaking would be specific to eldest daughters. Although the association between offspring survival and helping patterns seems highly probable, there is no confirmation that child caretaking per se is the relevant variable. Contrary to nonhuman helpers at the nest, workloads of children range from housekeeping to light agricultural tasks, and are not focused on assisting younger siblings. The improvement of reproductive success is probably the result of multiple interactions, among which the network of kinship would play a role at both the levels of economy and reciprocal assistance.},

The purpose of this effort is to demonstrate  that the demographic characteristics of a population influence its  child care practices and provides clues to understanding child care  patterns. Traditional practices and provides clues to understanding  child care patterns.  Traditional practices including multiple  caregiving, multistage play groups, and parents or siblings as cultural  transmitters are reviewed in a demographic context.  Other emerging  practices are also discussed: the role of stepparents and differential  parental investment in sons and daughters.  Anthropological data  published and unpublished included only those using standardized  methods on total fertility, infant or child mortality, and/or sex/age  distribution. Problems with the data set include limited cultural  representation, small study sizes, limited time trends, and  reliability.  There is a concentration on the ]Kung San, Efe, Aka,  Gidjingali, Yanomamo, Dusan, Semai, and Kipsigis.  Only 7 of the 57 are  outside the tropics.  Foragers are farmers are primarily represented,  because the pastoralists are primarily East African and smaller  samples.  Tables provide cultural specific data on total fertility  rates (TRF), infant and child mortality, and sex ratios at birth and  among the juvenile and adult population.  Sections are devoted to  methods, general patterns, traditional characteristics of childcare  based on 5 hypotheses, and emergent trends with 2 more hypotheses on  stepparenting and male preference.  2 patterns prevail: 1) hunter  gatherers and horticulturalists/pastoralists show great intercultural  variability in fertility and mortality rates, and 2) the ranges and  means of both groups are very similiar.  In the discussion of specific  cultures, the hypothesis is proposed and then examples are drawn from  the 57 studies to provide support or rejection of the hypothesis.  The  1st postulated that the level of multiple care increases with the  number of adult women without children increasing.  The 2nd hypothesis  is that the greater the density or compactness of the settlement, the  greater the level of multiple care.  It is reasoned in the 3rd that  fertility and mortality patterns influence the nature of indulgent care  of infants.  The 4th hypothesis is that sex and age distributions and  compactness of the camp influence the nature of the play ground and  type of supervision.  The 5th is that father involvement will be  greater in societies with low population densities or isolated.  The  6th is that a child rarely stays with natural parents throughout the  dependency period.  The 7th is that male biased juvenile sex ratios  will exist in societies where the cost of raising males is  or = that  of raising families, or where males contribute more calories to the  diet, or where male mortality is high.},

abstract = {This paper presents and discusses new model life tables at very low mortality, which make use of age-specific death rates from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. These life tables fit recorded death rates in very low mortality populations better than do the existing ones at expectations of life of 77.5 and 80 years. The old tables incorporate too-high mortality at the higher ages and in infancy and they incorporate regional differences that no longer exist. The new tables "close out" the mortality schedules above age 80 more realistically. The convergence of age patterns of mortality at very high life expectancies in populations that used to conform to different families is in itself of demographic interest. Some convergence may perhaps be expected. Sullivan (1973) found that, in Taiwan, the comparison of mortality at ages 1-5 to mortality at 5-35 in the late 1950s showed higher mortality at the younger ages relative to the ensuing 30-year age interval than was found in any of the models, including the South model, which has the highest relative mortality from ages 1-5 among the 4 regional patterns. Then, in the late 1960s, the relation of mortality at 1-5 to mortality at 5-35 in Taiwan fell to a position intermediate between the West and South tables. Sullivan found in data on mortality by cause of death a large reduction in mortality from diarrhea and enteritis, no doubt as a result of environmental sanitation. Mortality from these causes is concentrated among young children, and reduction in deaths from these causes would naturally diminish the excess mortality in this age interval. The East pattern, characterized by very high mortality in infancy (but not from 1-5), may be the result of the prevalence of early weaning or avoidance of breast feeding altogether in the populations characterized by this pattern. As health conditions have improved, evidenced by the overall design of mortality, these special factors are diminished or erased. Model life tables at these very low mortality levels have different uses from most applications of model life tables at higher mortality. The use of model tables to estimate accurate schedules of mortality when the basic data are incomplete or inaccurate is less relevant in this range of mortality levels.},

The prevalence of a standard form for first-marriage frequency implies that the proportion ever-married in any cohort also rises along a standard curve, subject to choice of origin (the earliest age of first marriage), vertical scale (the proportion ever-marrying by the end of life), and horizontal scale (the pace at which the proportion ever-married increases with age).

The 3 chapters of the introductory text present a general description of model life tables and stable populations, a brief account of the methods of calculation used to construct the tables, and illustrative uses of the tables and explanations of the terms and symbols employed. The life tables presented were calculated on the basis of the joint use of data originating from continuous registration and from an enumeration of the population at a given time. A basic collection was obtained containing 326 male and 326 female life tables. The 4 families of life tables presented in this volume are the result of a search for several distinctive patterns in the variation of mortality rates with age. 9 principal sets of correlations were experimented with for each sex: tables before 1870; tables for Russia and certain Balkan areas; tables for selected Central European areas; tables for Scandinavian countries; tables for Spain, Portugal, and Southern Italy; tables for Switzerland; tables for countries with reliable data and previously not included; tables reflecting mortality when there is an unusually high incidence of tuberculosis; and modern tables based on relatively inaccurate data, primarily from Asia, Africa, and Latin America - See more at: http://www.popline.org/node/518354{\#}sthash.0noigfJu.dpuf},

abstract = {We describe the trajectory of the human sex ratio from conception to birth by analyzing data from (i) 3- to 6-d-old embryos, (ii) induced abortions, (iii) chorionic villus sampling, (iv) amniocentesis, and (v) fetal deaths and live births. Our dataset is the most comprehensive and largest ever assembled to estimate the sex ratio at conception and the sex ratio trajectory and is the first, to our knowledge, to include all of these types of data. Our estimate of the sex ratio at conception is 0.5 (proportion male), which contradicts the common claim that the sex ratio at conception is male-biased. The sex ratio among abnormal embryos is male-biased, and the sex ratio among normal embryos is female-biased. These biases are associated with the abnormal/normal state of the sex chromosomes and of chromosomes 15 and 17. The sex ratio may decrease in the first week or so after conception (due to excess male mortality); it then increases for at least 10–15 wk (due to excess female mortality), levels off after ∼20 wk, and declines slowly from 28 to 35 wk (due to excess male mortality). Total female mortality during pregnancy exceeds total male mortality. The unbiased sex ratio at conception, the increase in the sex ratio during the first trimester, and total mortality during pregnancy being greater for females are fundamental insights into early human development.},

abstract = {Empirical evidence for declines in fitness components (survival and reproductive performance) with age has recently accumulated in wild populations, highlighting that the process of senescence is nearly ubiquitous in the living world. Senescence patterns are highly variable among species and current evolutionary theories of ageing propose that such variation can be accounted for by differences in allocation to growth and reproduction during early life. Here, we compiled 26 studies of free-ranging vertebrate populations that explicitly tested for a trade-off between performance in early and late life. Our review brings overall support for the presence of early-late life trade-offs, suggesting that the limitation of available resources leads individuals to trade somatic maintenance later in life for high allocation to reproduction early in life. We discuss our results in the light of two closely related theories of ageing-the disposable soma and the antagonistic pleiotropy theories-and propose that the principle of energy allocation roots the ageing process in the evolution of life-history strategies. Finally, we outline research topics that should be investigated in future studies, including the importance of natal environmental conditions in the study of trade-offs between early- and late-life performance and the evolution of sex-differences in ageing patterns.},

abstract = {Integral Projection Models (IPMs) use information on how an individual's state influences its vital rates - survival, growth and reproduction - to make population projections. IPMs are constructed from regression models predicting vital rates from state variables (e.g., size or age) and covariates (e.g., environment). By combining regressions of vital rates, an IPM provides mechanistic insight into emergent ecological patterns such as population dynamics, species geographic distributions, or life history strategies. Here, we review important resources for building IPMs and provide a comprehensive guide, with extensive R code, for their construction. IPMs can be applied to any stage-structured population; here we illustrate IPMs for a series of plant life histories of increasing complexity and biological realism, highlighting the utility of various regression methods for capturing biological patterns. We also present case studies illustrating how IPMs can be used to predict species' geographic distributions and life history strategies. IPMs can represent a wide range of life histories at any desired level of biological detail. Much of the strength of IPMs lies in the strength of regression models. Many subtleties arise when scaling from vital rate regressions to population-level patterns, so we provide a set of diagnostics and guidelines to ensure that models are biologically plausible. Moreover, IPMs can exploit a large existing suite of analytical tools developed for Matrix Projection Models. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The evolutionary theory of senescence posits that as the probability of extrinsic mortality increases with age, selection should favour early-life over late-life reproduction. Studies on natural vertebrate populations show early reproduction may impair later-life performance, but the consequences for lifetime fitness have rarely been determined, and little is known of whether similar patterns apply to mammals which typically live for several decades. We used a longitudinal dataset on Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) to investigate associations between early-life reproduction and female age-specific survival, fecundity and offspring survival to independence, as well as lifetime breeding success (lifetime number of calves produced). Females showed low fecundity following sexual maturity, followed by a rapid increase to a peak at age 19 and a subsequent decline. High early life reproductive output (before the peak of performance) was positively associated with subsequent age-specific fecundity and offspring survival, but significantly impaired a female's own later-life survival. Despite the negative effects of early reproduction on late-life survival, early reproduction is under positive selection through a positive association with lifetime breeding success. Our results suggest a trade-off between early reproduction and later survival which is maintained by strong selection for high early fecundity, and thus support the prediction from life history theory that high investment in reproductive success in early life is favoured by selection through lifetime fitness despite costs to later-life survival. That maternal survival in elephants depends on previous reproductive investment also has implications for the success of (semi-)captive breeding programmes of this endangered species.},

Mortality deceleration-the slowing of mortality's rise with age-has been considered an important window into heterogeneity that otherwise might be impossible to explore. In this article, I argue that deceleration patterns may reveal surprisingly little about the heterogeneity that putatively produces them. I show that even in a very simple model-one that is composed of just two subpopulations with Gompertz mortality-(1) aggregate mortality can decelerate even while a majority of the cohort is frail; (2) multiple decelerations are possible; and (3) mortality selection can produce acceleration as well as deceleration. Simulations show that these patterns are plausible in model cohorts that in the aggregate resemble cohorts in the Human Mortality Database. I argue that these results challenge some conventional heuristics for understanding the relationship between selection and deceleration; undermine certain inferences from deceleration timing to patterns of social inequality; and imply that standard parametric models, assumed to plateau at most once, may sometimes badly misestimate deceleration timing-even by decades.},

Iterative Proportional Fitting is used to find a marriage function (an age distribution of new marriages for both sexes), in a stable reference population, that is consistent with the one-sex age distributions of new marriages, and includes age preference. The one-sex age distributions (which are the marginals of the two-sex distribution) are based on the Picrate model, and age preference on a normal distribution, both of which may be adjusted by choice of parameter values. For a population that is perturbed from the reference state, the total number of new marriages is found as the harmonic mean of target totals for men and women obtained by applying reference population marriage rates to the perturbed population. The marriage function uses the age preference function, assumed to be the same for the reference and the perturbed populations, to distribute the total number of new marriages. The marriage function also has an availability factor that varies as the population changes with time, where availability depends on the supply of unmarried men and women. To simplify exposition, only first marriage is treated, and the algorithm is illustrated by application to Zambia. In the second paper, remarriage and dissolution are included.},

abstract = {Demographic models are commonly used to study cetacean population dynamics and are characterized by a wide range of age classes. The primary building blocks are age-specific survival or mortality and birth rates, which can be combined using a Leslie matrix protocol to provide estimates of maximum possible rates of increase for population size. In this context, specific mortality data are valuable for modeling the viability of threatened species. Depletion of prey, pollution, and other anthropogenic disturbances are believed to have contributed to the decline of populations, but the evidence is less conclusive for these factors than for bycatch. In an attempt to estimate a population growth rate that incorporates uncertainties in vital parameters, we apply a random Leslie analysis to calculate effective growth rate for the time-dependent mean-value population. Here we provide the algorithm to implement it for a general 13. ×. 13 random survival model. An effective growth rate can be characterized by studying the time evolution of the mean-value population vector state (in an age-structured description). We show that the asymptotic behavior of the mean-value vector state, which characterizes the population growth rate when the model has random vital parameters, exhibits a value that is below previously expected potential estimations. We demonstrate the procedure using bibliographic revision data of the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in Canadian waters, subjected to incidental mortality. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Caswell2013,
abstract = {1. Senescence (an increase in the mortality rate or force of mortality, or a decrease in fertility, with increasing age) is a widespread phenomenon. Theories about the evolution of senescence have long focused on the age trajectories of the selection gradients on mortality and fertility. In purely age-classified models, these selection gradients are non-increasing with age, implying that traits expressed early in life have a greater impact on fitness than traits expressed later in life. This pattern leads inevitably to the evolution of senescence if there are trade-offs between early and late performance. 2. It has long been suspected that the stage- or size-dependent demography typical of plants might change these conclusions. In this paper, we develop a model that includes both stage- and age-dependence and derive the age-dependent, stage-dependent and age×stage-dependent selection gradients on mortality and fertility. 3. We applied this model to stage-classified population projection matrices for 36 species of plants, from a wide variety of growth forms (from mosses to trees) and habitats. 4. We found that the age-specific selection gradients within a life cycle stage can exhibit increases with age (we call these contra-senescent selection gradients). In later stages, often large size classes in plant demography, the duration of these contra-senescent gradients can exceed the life expectancy by several fold. 5. Synthesis. The interaction of age- and stage-dependence in plants leads to selection pressures on senescence fundamentally different from those found in previous, age-classified theories. This result may explain the observation that large plants seem less subject to senescence than most kinds of animals. The methods presented here can lead to improved analysis of both age-dependent and stage-dependent demographic properties of plant populations.},

abstract = {1. Matrix population models are widely used to describe population dynamics, conduct population viability analyses and derive management recommendations for plant populations. For endangered or invasive species, management decisions are often based on small demographic data sets. Hence, there is a need for population models which accurately assess population performance from such small data sets. 2. We used demographic data on two perennial herbs with different life histories to compare the accuracy and precision of the traditional matrix population model and the recently developed integral projection model (IPM) in relation to the amount of data. 3. For large data sets both matrix models and IPMs produced identical estimates of population growth rate (lambda). However, for small data sets containing fewer than 300 individuals, IPMs often produced smaller bias and variance for lambda than matrix models despite different matrix structures and sampling techniques used to construct the matrix population models. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the smaller bias and variance of lambda estimates make IPMs preferable to matrix population models for small demographic data sets with a few hundred individuals. These results are likely to be applicable to a wide range of herbaceous, perennial plant species where demographic fate can be modelled as a function of a continuous state variable such as size. We recommend the use of IPMs to assess population performance and management strategies particularly for endangered or invasive perennial herbs where little demographic data are available.},

These generalizations have been challenged because of limitations of life-table approaches and the growing appreciation that senescence is more than an increasing probability of death. Without using life tables, we examine senescence rates in annual individual fitness using 20 individual-based data sets of terrestrial vertebrates with contrasting life histories and body size. We find that senescence is widespread in the wild and equally likely to occur in survival and reproduction. Additionally, mammals senesce faster than birds because they have a faster life history for a given body size. By allowing us to disentangle the effects of two major fitness components our methods allow an assessment of the robustness of the prevalent life-table approach. Focusing on one aspect of life history - survival or recruitment - can provide reliable information on overall senescence.},

abstract = {Markovian population models are used in conservation biology to find an accurate estimate of a population's extinction probability. Such models require handling of large transition matrices and calculations are thus extremely time-consuming when large populations have to be studied. To accomplish these problems, some authors have suggested to group together several states/sizes of the population. Unfortunately, this so-called binning frequently results in errors in estimates obtained. The main problem with binning is that it assumes that grouped states behave nearly identical with respect to the underlying stochastic population process and that so far binning methods implicitly violate this assumption. In this paper, we present a new binning method based on self-organizing Kohonen neural networks for time-homogeneous Markovian metapopulation models. The neural networks are used to analyse one-step transitions of the Markov chain in order to group only nearly identical states. We show that the new method is more qualified for the use in conservation than deterministic methods that we had discussed in a previous paper (first order Fibonacci binning, pairs binning). It reveals more accurate and more reliable estimates than these methods. Errors in estimated extinction probabilities that were introduced by binning did not exceed one order of magnitude and errors in the global population size did not exceed 30{\%}. These errors in estimates correspond to a low inaccuracy in model parameter values of population growth and migration ranging from ??1 to ??10{\%}. The reduction in the state space of the studied metapopulations ranged from 21 to 33{\%} per subpopulation. The resulting decrease in computing time caused by our binning method is substantial particularly with regard to simulations tasks such as comparing the extinction risk of several populations or performing a detailed sensitivity analysis for model parameters assumed. The successful estimation of the extinction risk of eight natural butterfly populations demonstrates the applicability of our new binning method in conservation biology. A comparison of extinction probabilities and mean population sizes estimated by Monte Carlo simulations [Griebeler, E.M., Seitz, A., 2002. An individual based model for the conservation of the endangered Large Blue butterfly, Maculinea arion (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). Ecol. Model. 134, 343-356] with those obtained from the respective Markov chains for these butterfly populations revealed similar results on the accuracy of estimates and the reduction in transition matrices that were predicted by the comparative error analysis for binning methods. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

An individual's contribution to population growth is an individual's realized annual fitness. We demonstrate how the quantities we develop can be used to address a range of empirical questions, and provide an application to a detailed dataset of Soay sheep.

abstract = {Several predator species at risk of extinction in Southwestern Europe are dependent on the population density of European wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus. Rabbit populations in the region, however, have recently undergone dramatic decreases in population density, which may be exacerbated by hunting. Current hunting policies set the autumn-winter season, just before the start of rabbit reproduction, as the main hunting season, and previous theoretical models have estimated that the current hunting season may have the greatest negative impact on rabbit abundance and should be changed. We utilised a model for rabbit population dynamics to determine the effects of the timing of hunting during two seasons, summer and autumn, on the tendency of rabbit populations to be over-harvested and on the number of rabbits hunted. This model included field estimates of age- and sex-selection biases of hunting by shotgun. Scenarios with different hunting rates and sex- and age-selection probabilities of hunting were simulated for populations with different turnover levels and with and without compensatory mortality mechanisms. Field estimations showed that hunting in summer was juvenile-biased whereas autumn hunting was juvenile- and male-biased. In contrast to previous findings, our modelling results suggested that hunting in autumn may be the most conservative option for harvesting of rabbit populations, since these populations were more prone to be over-harvested during the summer. The differences between the two seasons in number of rabbits hunted were dependent on population dynamics and hunting sex- and age-selection probabilities. Our findings suggest that altering of current hunting policies would not optimise the exploitation or conservation of wild rabbit populations, but that the latter may be improved by some changes in the timing of hunting. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Negative senescence is characterized by a decline in mortality with age after reproductive maturity, generally accompanied by an increase in fecundity. Hamilton (1966) ruled out negative senescence: we adumbrate the deficiencies of his model. We review empirical studies of various plants and some kinds of animals that may experience negative senescence and conclude that negative senescence may be widespread, especially in indeterminate-growth species for which size and fertility increase with age. We develop optimization models of life-history strategies that demonstrate that negative senescence is theoretically possible. More generally, our models contribute to understanding of the evolutionary and demographic forces that mold the age-trajectories of mortality, fertility and growth. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In an age- or stage- structured population, a given change on a proportional$\backslash$nscale of different fitness components has different effects on the$\backslash$npopulation growth rate. Because earlier studies have shown that variability$\backslash$nis selectively disadvantageous for long-lived iteroparous species,$\backslash$nfitness components whose variation has greatest impact on the population$\backslash$ngrowth rate are expected to be canalized against temporal variability.$\backslash$nWe present here a test for such a canalization of fitness components$\backslash$nmost influential for population growth. If canalization occurs, (1)$\backslash$nwithin a given population the variance of canalized fitness components$\backslash$nshould be less than that of noncanalized components, and (2) among$\backslash$npopulations an inverse relationship should occur between the potential$\backslash$ndemographic impact of fitness components and their temporal variability.$\backslash$nWe tested these hypotheses using data on age-dependent survival of$\backslash$nungulates. As expected for long-lived vertebrates, elasticities and$\backslash$nsensitivities of adult survival were consistently higher than for$\backslash$njuvenile survival. In support of the canalization hypothesis, the$\backslash$nvariance of juvenile survival with low potential demographic impact$\backslash$non fitness was consistently higher than the variance of adult survival$\backslash$nwith high potential demographic impact on fitness, in all of 22 ungulate$\backslash$npopulations for which long-term demographic monitoring data were$\backslash$navailable. However, a negative co-variation between potential impact$\backslash$non fitness and temporal variation could also be accounted for by$\backslash$nalternative hypotheses, the lower resistance of growing individuals$\backslash$nto environmental "insults," or reduced adult phenotypic$\backslash$nvariability due to selective mortality of juveniles. To differentiate$\backslash$nbetween canalization of adult survival and frailty/selective mortality$\backslash$nof juveniles, we included five populations of small mammals. We then$\backslash$nfound a negative relationship between the relative potential impact$\backslash$nof age-dependent survival on fitness and the relative variability$\backslash$nof age-dependent survival, especially for populations faced with$\backslash$nhigh environmental variation. This remained true after correcting$\backslash$nfor differences in mean survival of juveniles and adults and was$\backslash$nindependent of phylogeny. Although more data are required to extend$\backslash$nthe hypothesis to other taxonomic groups, we conclude that available$\backslash$ndata support the idea that adult survival of ungulates is canalized$\backslash$nagainst temporal variation. Therefore, contrasted responses of juvenile$\backslash$nand prime-age survival to environmental variaton in ungulates may$\backslash$nbe adaptive and could be viewed as a bet-hedging strategy.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis can be defined as the set of analytical and simulation- based tools that evaluates how changes in life-history attributes of a de- mographic model affect population growth or rate of extinction. We describe four approaches to sensitivity analysis: (1) manual perturbation of deterministic and stochastic models, (2) analytical elasticity analysis, (3) life-table response experiment (LTRE), and (4) life-stage simulation analysis (LSA). In a case study using data from snow geese, we address two emerging issues in sensitivity analysis, First, although sensitivity analysis has typically been applied to single populations, it has potential to clarify metap{\~{}}{\~{}}ulation processes by quantifying the importance of among- versus within-population dynamics; our example shows that, rel- ative to other life-history attributes, connectivity among populations has a strong impact on population growth. Second, variation in vital rates has been identified as a critical component of sensitivity analysis, yet the variation usually obtained from field estimates contains sampling variation (variation inherent in estimating vital rates) in addition to the relevant process variation (arising from spatial and temporal variation). Using the snow goose data, we find that conservation inferences based on total variation (sampling + process variation) can differ from those based on process variation alone. Sensitivity analysis is an essential coun- terpart to population viability analysis, because it goes beyond identi- fying a problem and helps define the most effective solutions. Advances in both data collection and model evaluation must move forward in tan- dem to obtain the unique insights possible under sensitivity analysis.},

This new stochastic force, which is called genetic draft, causes genetic variation at the neutral locus to decrease with population size and the rate of deleterious substitution to increase with population size. The fact that heterozygosities in natural populations are only weakly dependent on population size suggests that genetic draft may be a much more important stochastic force than genetic drift in natural populations. Some of the mathematical properties of genetic draft are explored.},

abstract = {The role of environmental variation in the population dynamics of the tropical understory shrub Ardisia escallonioides was explored using single-environment matrix analysis and dynamic-environment megamatrix analysis. We investigated how variation in forest-canopy openness caused by hurricanes affected population dynamics. A 7 ? 7 patch- transition matrix was created to model forest dynamics based on the historical frequency and strength of hurricanes in south Florida. Seven 8 ? 8 stage-classified matrices for plant population dynamics were derived from four field populations and two posthurricane years. These populations spanned a strong gradient of forest-canopy openness resulting from hurricane disturbance caused by Hurricane Andrew (24 August 1992). The patch-transition matrix was analyzed for its stable patch distribution. The seven single-environment matrices were each analyzed for population growth rates and elasticity of stage classes. The 56 ? 56 megamatrix was analyzed for population growth rate, reproductive value, stable patch- stage distribution, and elasticity of both patches and stages. Population growth rate of the single-environment matrix models (8 ? 8) was lowest for the shadiest environment (?? 1.0), intermediate but variable for intermediate envi- ronments, and highest for the most open environment (?? 1.96). The population growth rate (?) of the megamatrix model was 1.71. The stable patch-stage distribution was char- acterized by a high proportion of seeds in open patches. Reproductive value was highest for very large adults in open patches. Megamatrix elasticity analysis revealed several com- ponents of the demography that were not apparent from examination of the single-envi- ronment matrices. Although closed-canopy patches were the most common type of envi- ronment, elasticity analysis of the megamatrix showed that the highest patch elasticity was for the most open environment.We found contrasting predictions for the relative importance of life history stages to population growth rate from single-environment analysis vs. the megamatrix analysis. In the most common single-environment patch, very large adults had the highest elasticity. In the megamatrix, small juveniles contributed the most elasticity and all stages contributed some elasticity. For plant species inhabiting temporally varying environments, megamatrix analysis offers new insight into the importance of both patches and stage classes.},

abstract = {Life table response experiments (LTREs) are studies that quantify the population-level effects of environmental factors by measuring a set of vital rates (a life table) under two or more conditions (treatments). The vital rates are incorporated into a demographic model and the population growth rate lambda is calculated to summarize the treatment effects at the population level. A previous paper introduced a way to measure the contribution of each vital rate to the overall treatment effect on lambda. Here, I generalize this method from age-classified models to models based on size or stage. I present methods for three parameterizations (in terms of the matrix entries, in terms of lower-level vital rates, and in terms of the life cycle graph, including age at maturity) of size- or stage-classified models. In each case, the contributions are calculated from the treatment effects on the vital rates and the sensitivity of lambda to changes in the vital rates. Examples are presented of the effects of fire on a tropical grass, of geographical location on killer whales (orcas), and of pollutants on a marine polychaete. In analyzing LTREs, it is not safe to assume that the most obvious treatment effects on the vital rates are the most important.},

We replicated Boyce's (1977, 1979) simulations of population growth with age structure and a single randomly varying vital statistic, and reconciled some of these differences. Mean number can be projected using the dominant eigenvalue of the mean Leslie matrix, but the modal number may be considerably lower. We compared several measures of the rate of growth of the geometric mean or median of numbers and conclude that Tuljapurkar's [alpha] is an acceptable measure.},

Here we argue, through a simple theoretical model, that such correlations arise from selection pressures for efficient learning of behavior sequences. We define intelligence operationally as the ability to disregard unrewarding behavior sequences, without trying them out, in the search for rewarding sequences. We show that increasing a species' behavioral repertoire increases the number of rewarding behavior sequences that can be performed, but also the time required to learn such sequences. This trade-off results in an optimal repertoire size that decreases rapidly with increasing sequence length. Behavioral repertoire size can be increased by increasing intelligence or lengthening the lifespan, giving rise to the observed correlations between these traits.},

abstract = {In this paper we unify, simplify, and extend previous work on the evolutionary dynamics of symmetric N-player matrix games with two pure strategies. In such games, gains from switching strategies depend, in general, on how many other individuals in the group play a given strategy. As a consequence, the gain function determining the gradient of selection can be a polynomial of degree N-1. In order to deal with the intricacy of the resulting evolutionary dynamics, we make use of the theory of polynomials in Bernstein form. This theory implies a tight link between the sign pattern of the gains from switching on the one hand and the number and stability of the rest points of the replicator dynamics on the other hand. While this relationship is a general one, it is most informative if gains from switching have at most two sign changes, as is the case for most multi-player matrix games considered in the literature. We demonstrate that previous results for public goods games are easily recovered and extended using this observation. Further examples illustrate how focusing on the sign pattern of the gains from switching obviates the need for a more involved analysis.},

Here, we study evolutionary branching in a deme-structured population by constructing a quantitative genetic model for the trait variance dynamics, which allows us to obtain an analytic condition for evolutionary branching. This is first shown to agree with previous conditions for branching expressed in terms of relatedness between interacting individuals within demes and obtained from mutant-resident systems. We then show this branching condition can be markedly simplified when the evolving trait affect fecundity and/or survival, as opposed to affecting population structure, which would occur in the case of the evolution of dispersal. As an application of our model, we evaluate the threshold migration rate below which evolutionary branching cannot occur in a pairwise interaction game. This agrees very well with the individual-based simulation results.},

abstract = {In order to understand the development of non-genetically encoded actions during an animal's lifespan, it is necessary to analyze the dynamics and evolution of learning rules producing behavior. Owing to the intrinsic stochastic and frequency-dependent nature of learning dynamics, these rules are often studied in evolutionary biology via agent-based computer simulations. In this paper, we show that stochastic approximation theory can help to qualitatively understand learning dynamics and formulate analytical models for the evolution of learning rules. We consider a population of individuals repeatedly interacting during their lifespan, and where the stage game faced by the individuals fluctuates according to an environmental stochastic process. Individuals adjust their behavioral actions according to learning rules belonging to the class of experience-weighted attraction learning mechanisms, which includes standard reinforcement and Bayesian learning as special cases. We use stochastic approximation theory in order to derive differential equations governing action play probabilities, which turn out to have qualitative features of mutator-selection equations. We then perform agent-based simulations to find the conditions where the deterministic approximation is closest to the original stochastic learning process for standard 2-action 2-player fluctuating games, where interaction between learning rules and preference reversal may occur. Finally, we analyze a simplified model for the evolution of learning in a producer-scrounger game, which shows that the exploration rate can interact in a non-intuitive way with other features of co-evolving learning rules. Overall, our analyses illustrate the usefulness of applying stochastic approximation theory in the study of animal learning. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Whole-genome sequence is potentially the richest source of genetic data for inferring ancestral demography. However, full sequence also presents significant challenges to fully utilize such large data sets and to ensure that sequencing errors do not introduce bias into the inferred demography. Using whole-genome sequence data from two Holstein cattle, we demonstrate a new method to correct for bias caused by hidden errors and then infer stepwise changes in ancestral demography up to present. There was a strong upward bias in estimates of recent effective population size (Ne) if the correction method was not applied to the data, both for our method and the Li and Durbin (Inference of human population history from individual whole-genome sequences. Nature 475:493-496) pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent method. To infer demography, we use an analytical predictor of multiloci linkage disequilibrium (LD) based on a simple coalescent model that allows for changes in Ne. The LD statistic summarizes the distribution of runs of homozygosity for any given demography. We infer a best fit demography as one that predicts a match with the observed distribution of runs of homozygosity in the corrected sequence data. We use multiloci LD because it potentially holds more information about ancestral demography than pairwise LD. The inferred demography indicates a strong reduction in the Ne around 170,000 years ago, possibly related to the divergence of African and European Bos taurus cattle. This is followed by a further reduction coinciding with the period of cattle domestication, with Ne of between 3,500 and 6,000. The most recent reduction of Ne to approximately 100 in the Holstein breed agrees well with estimates from pedigrees. Our approach can be applied to whole-genome sequence from any diploid species and can be scaled up to use sequence from multiple individuals.},

On the other hand, quantitative modeling indicates that some "ultraconserved" words exist that might be used to find evidence for deep linguistic relationships beyond that time barrier. Here we use a statistical model, which takes into account the frequency with which words are used in common everyday speech, to predict the existence of a set of such highly conserved words among seven language families of Eurasia postulated to form a linguistic superfamily that evolved from a common ancestor around 15,000 y ago. We derive a dated phylogenetic tree of this proposed superfamily with a time-depth of {\~{}}14,450 y, implying that some frequently used words have been retained in related forms since the end of the last ice age. Words used more than once per 1,000 in everyday speech were 7- to 10-times more likely to show deep ancestry on this tree. Our results suggest a remarkable fidelity in the transmission of some words and give theoretical justification to the search for features of language that might be preserved across wide spans of time and geography.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing number of studies attempting to model population growth in various organisms, we still know relatively little about the population dynamics of long-lived species that reproduce only in the later stages of their life cycle, such as trees. Predictions of the dynamics of these species are, however, urgently needed for planning management actions when species are either endangered or invasive. In long-lived species, a single management intervention may have consequences for several decades, and detailed knowledge of long-term performance can therefore elucidate possible outcomes during the management planning phase.

METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied the population dynamics of an invasive tree species, Pinus strobus, in three habitat types represented by their position along the elevation gradient occupied by the species. In agreement with previous studies on the population dynamics of long-lived perennials, our results show that the survival of the largest trees exhibits the highest elasticity in all of the studied habitats. In contrast, life table response experiments (LTRE) analysis showed that different stages contribute the most to population growth rates in different habitats, with generative reproduction being more important in lower slopes and valley bottoms and survival being more important on rock tops and upper slopes.

CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that P. strobus exhibits different growth strategies in different habitats that result in similar population growth rates. We propose that this plasticity in growth strategies is a key factor in the invasion success of the white pine. In all of the investigated habitats, the population growth rates are above 1, indicating that the population of the species is still increasing and has the ability to spread and occupy a wide range of habitats.},

abstract = {Human populations vary demographically with population sizes ranging from small groups of hunter-gatherers with less than fifty individuals to vast cities containing many millions. Here we investigate how the cultural transmission of traits affecting survival, fertility, or both can influence the birth rate, age structure, and asymptotic growth rate of a population. We show that the strong spread of such a trait can lead to a demographic transition, similar to that experienced in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, without using ecological or economic optimizing models. We also show that the spread of a cultural trait that increases fertility, but not survival, can cause demographic change similar to the 'Neolithic demographic transition': a period of increased population growth that is thought to have accompanied the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural lifestyles. We investigate the roles of vertical, oblique, and horizontal learning of such a trait in this transition and find that compared to vertical learning alone, horizontal and oblique learning can accelerate the trait's spread, lead to faster population growth, and increase its equilibrium frequency.},

abstract = {We consider a neutral dynamical model of biological diversity, where individuals live and reproduce independently. They have i.i.d. lifetime durations (which are not necessarily exponentially distributed) and give birth (singly) at constant rate b. Such a genealogical tree is usually called a splitting tree, and the population counting process (N{\_}t;t$\backslash$ge 0) is a homogeneous, binary Crump--Mode--Jagers process. We assume that individuals independently experience mutations at constant rate $\backslash$theta during their lifetimes, under the infinite-alleles assumption: each mutation instantaneously confers a brand new type, called allele, to its carrier. We are interested in the allele frequency spectrum at time t, i.e., the number A(t) of distinct alleles represented in the population at time t, and more specifically, the numbers A(k,t) of alleles represented by k individuals at time t, k=1,2,...,N{\_}t. We mainly use two classes of tools: coalescent point processes and branching processes counted by random characteristics. We provide explicit formulae for the expectation of A(k,t) in a coalescent point process conditional on population size, which apply to the special case of splitting trees. We separately derive the a.s. limits of A(k,t)/N{\_}t and of A(t)/N{\_}t thanks to random characteristics. Last, we separately compute the expected homozygosity by applying a method characterizing the dynamics of the tree distribution as the origination time of the tree moves back in time, in the spirit of backward Kolmogorov equations.},

abstract = {Data-driven studies of identity by descent (IBD) were recently enabled by high-resolution genomic data from large cohorts and scalable algorithms for IBD detection. Yet, haplotype sharing currently represents an underutilized source of information for population-genetics research. We present analytical results on the relationship between haplotype sharing across purportedly unrelated individuals and a population's demographic history. We express the distribution of IBD sharing across pairs of individuals for segments of arbitrary length as a function of the population's demography, and we derive an inference procedure to reconstruct such demographic history. The accuracy of the proposed reconstruction methodology was extensively tested on simulated data. We applied this methodology to two densely typed data sets: 500 Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) individuals and 56 Kenyan Maasai (MKK) individuals (HapMap 3 data set). Reconstructing the demographic history of the AJ cohort, we recovered two subsequent population expansions, separated by a severe founder event, consistent with previous analysis of lower-throughput genetic data and historical accounts of AJ history. In the MKK cohort, high levels of cryptic relatedness were detected. The spectrum of IBD sharing is consistent with a demographic model in which several small-sized demes intermix through high migration rates and result in enrichment of shared long-range haplotypes. This scenario of historically structured demographies might explain the unexpected abundance of runs of homozygosity within several populations. ?? 2012 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

Previous studies, however, have only examined the average effect of father's presence on child survivorship. Here we assess the total fitness cost to men of deserting (or the benefit of staying), by considering effects on the entire progeny. We estimate the total number of children that a deserting father can expect to lose due to reduced survivorship over the life course in five populations, and compare this loss to the benefit gains from remarrying a younger wife.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We compiled the observed impacts of father's absence, as well as mortality and fertility schedules, for five foraging or foraging/horticultural populations. We calculate how many additional children a man can expect to lose due to father's absence throughout a marriage. We then calculate the minimum age difference between a first and second spouse that would be necessary to overcome this cost.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Because child mortality rates drop so rapidly, the costs that men experience from desertion due to augmented child mortality are modest throughout marriage. Even hypothetically inflated father effects can be overcome with modest age differences between first and second spouses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Returns to paternal investment in terms of increased child survival are not substantial compared to those received by successfully practicing a serial mating strategy. This suggests that factors other than the ability to enhance child survival, such as female choice, are important to the evolutionary history and continued adaptive functioning of men's unique reproductive strategies.},

abstract = {Researchers must understand how mutations affect survival at various ages to understand how ageing evolves. Many models linking mutation to age-specific survival have been proposed but there is little evidence to indicate which model is most appropriate. This is a serious problem because the predicted evolutionary endpoints of ageing depend upon the details of the specific model. We apply an explicitly quantitative genetic perspective to the problem. To determine the inheritance of dichotomous traits (such as survival), quantitative genetics has long employed a threshold model. Beginning from first principles, we show how this is the most defensible mutational model for age-specific survival and how this, relative to the standard model, predicts delayed senescence and mortality deceleration at late age. These are commonly observed patterns of ageing that heretofore have required more complicated survival models. We also show how this model can be developed further to unify quantitative genetics and evolutionary demography into a more complete conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of ageing.},

Established methods estimate kinship accurately for first-degree through third-degree relatives. We demonstrate that chromosomal segments shared by two individuals due to identity by descent (IBD) provide much additional information about shared ancestry. We developed a maximum-likelihood method for the estimation of recent shared ancestry (ERSA) from the number and lengths of IBD segments derived from high-density SNP or whole-genome sequence data. We used ERSA to estimate relationships from SNP genotypes in 169 individuals from three large, well-defined human pedigrees. ERSA is accurate to within one degree of relationship for 97{\%} of first-degree through fifth-degree relatives and 80{\%} of sixth-degree and seventh-degree relatives. We demonstrate that ERSA's statistical power approaches the maximum theoretical limit imposed by the fact that distant relatives frequently share no DNA through a common ancestor. ERSA greatly expands the range of relationships that can be estimated from genetic data and is implemented in a freely available software package.},

abstract = {The transition from hunting and gathering to farming involved a major cultural innovation that has spread rapidly over most of the globe in the last ten millennia. In sub-Saharan Africa, hunter-gatherers have begun to shift toward an agriculture-based lifestyle over the last 5,000 years. Only a few populations still base their mode of subsistence on hunting and gathering. The Pygmies are considered to be the largest group of mobile hunter-gatherers of Africa. They dwell in equatorial rainforests and are characterized by their short mean stature. However, little is known about the chronology of the demographic events-size changes, population splits, and gene flow--ultimately giving rise to contemporary Pygmy (Western and Eastern) groups and neighboring agricultural populations. We studied the branching history of Pygmy hunter-gatherers and agricultural populations from Africa and estimated separation times and gene flow between these populations. We resequenced 24 independent noncoding regions across the genome, corresponding to a total of approximately 33 kb per individual, in 236 samples from seven Pygmy and five agricultural populations dispersed over the African continent. We used simulation-based inference to identify the historical model best fitting our data. The model identified included the early divergence of the ancestors of Pygmy hunter-gatherers and farming populations approximately 60,000 years ago, followed by a split of the Pygmies' ancestors into the Western and Eastern Pygmy groups approximately 20,000 years ago. Our findings increase knowledge of the history of the peopling of the African continent in a region lacking archaeological data. An appreciation of the demographic and adaptive history of African populations with different modes of subsistence should improve our understanding of the influence of human lifestyles on genome diversity.},

It offers a framework to explain differences in the use of information and communication technologies in terms of differences in the institutional environment and the resulting investment climate. Using three measures of the quality of the investment climate, Internet access is shown to depend strongly on the country's institutional setting because fixed-line Internet investment is characterized by a high risk of state expropriation, given its considerable asset specificity. Mobile phone networks, on the other hand, are built on less site-specific, re-deployable modules, which make this technology less dependent on institutional characteristics. It is speculated that the existence of telecommunications technology that is less sensitive to the parameters of the institutional environment and, in particular, to poor investment protection provides an opportunity for better understanding of the constraints and prospects for economic development. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that, under mutation accumulation, inbreeding decline and three major components of genetic variance are expected to increase with age in randomly mating populations. Under the simplest version of the antagonistic pleiotropy model, no changes in the severity of inbreeding decline, dominance variance, or the genetic variance of chromosomal homozygotes are expected, but additive genetic variance may increase with age. Age-specific survival rates and mating success were measured on virgin males, using lines extracted from a population of Drosophila melanogaster. For both traits, inbreeding decline and several components of genetic variance increase with age. The results are consistent with the mutation accumulation model, but can only be explained by antagonistic pleiotropy if there is a general tendency for an increase with age in the size of allelic effects on these life-history traits.},

abstract = {Projection matrix models are widely used in population biology to project the present state of a population into the future, either as an attempt to forecast population dynamics, or as a way to evaluate life history hypotheses. These models are flexible and mathematically relatively easy. They have been applied to a broad range of plants and animals. The asymptotic properties of projection matrices have clearly defined biological interpretations, and the analysis of the effects of perturbations on these asymptotic properties offers new possibilities for comparative life history analysis. The connection between projection matrix models and the secondary theorem of natural selection opens life cycle phenomena to evolutionary interpretation.},

abstract = {Extensive seed longevity of some annual plants has been known for some time (e.g., Toole and Brown 1946); however the importance of a viable and long-lived seed bank has been appreciated only recently (Epling et al. 1960; Sarukhan 1974). The germination of seeds which have remained in the soil varying lengths of time implies that the generation time of annuals is greater than one year, and thus does not necessarily represent the extreme in life histories that textbooks often portray (e.g., Roughgarden 1979). Furthermore, accurate computation of the finite rate of increase and reproductive value requires the inclusion of terms for the dynamics of these seeds buried for various periods of time. Annual plants can be expected to dominate the attention of plant population biologists for some time, particularly in field experiments investigating the relative fitnesses of plants with alternative life histories. For such reasons, it is necessary that growth rates be measured with precision. The Leslie model (1945, 1948) provides an accurate and efficient method of obtaining the finite rate of increase of populations. This approach is useful because only data necessary to compute the growth rate need be gathered. Here we detail two possible models to project the population of an annual plant with a seed bank. In the first model we assume the seed bank decays by a fixed fraction each year indefinitely. This allows an ex- plicit expression for the finite rate of increase. The second model is an age class projection (Leslie) matrix, which may be more realistic in some cases. The relative sensitivity of the finite rate of increase (X) to proportional changes in the life history parameters is assessed for both models. The congruences and differences of the ranking of the sensitivity of X to changes in the life history parameters are discussed. The final aspect treated in this modeling of the growth rate projection of annual plant seed banks is an extension of the comparison of a perennial's fitness to an idealized annual (Cole 1954).},

abstract = {Many agencies require population estimates and projections by ethnic group. These projections need ethnic-specific, age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) but their inclusion is challenging since ethnicity is not recorded at birth registration. In this paper maternity data are used in a case study of electoral wards in Bradford, West Yorkshire, to develop fertility rates for small populations for a 1991 based projection. The challenge is to capture local variations in fertility by ethnic group when data are sparse. Small areas were grouped together using cluster analysis to define combinations with similar sociodemographic and fertility experiences so that sparse data could be aggregated to estimate reliable ethnic-specific fertility rates. For comparison, the data were aggregated into the 1991 Office for National Statistics area type classification. Fertility rates by single year of age for all area types were smoothed using the Hadwiger function. For the White ethnic group there were sufficient births to create ethnic-specific, ward-level ASFRs. For other ethnicities grouping of areas was necessary. The accuracy of the ASFRs in predicting births was assessed using mean absolute percentage error. Results show that for some minority groups district-level ethnic-specific fertility rates produced the most accurate birth estimates even though they were based on a larger area. This implies that rates created may be informative about the local area for White ethnic type but not in the same way for smaller ethnic groups. In terms of grouping strategies we recommend that existing classifications are assessed to determine how well variations in rates are stratified before embarking on a custom scheme. Where population sub-groups are small in some areas, it may be more reliable to use rates derived for larger areas and apply these to local populations. Inevitably, the rates used in a projection are a compromise but hopefully will still capture important dimensions of population change. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science and Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {We hypothesize that size at hatching strongly affects population dynamics of cannibalistic fish species and is a crucial determinant of how populations respond to selective removal of large individuals (harvesting). We use a mechanistic mathematical model to study the relation between hatching size and response to harvesting mortality, using Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) as a model organism. We show how hatching size determines dynamics through its effect on the relative strength of cannibalistic mortality and resource competition as mechanisms of population regulation. In populations with intermediate and large hatching size, cannibalistic mortality is an important determinant of population dynamics. and harvesting destabilizes population dynamics. When hatching size is small, population stability is less sensitive to this type of harvesting. Populations hatching at small size are regulated by competition, and harvesting large individuals affects such populations less. Harvesting can also induce the growth of very large individuals, absent in unharvested populations. Our results show that harvesting in cannibalistic lake fish populations can strongly alter Population dynamics in ways that can only be anticipated on the basis of mechanistic knowledge about how populations are regulated.},

abstract = {In cosmopolitan species, geographical variations in copy number and/or level of transposition activity have been observed for several transposable elements (TEs). Environment, history and population structure can contribute to such variation in ways that are difficult to tease apart. For the mariner element, previous studies of the geographic variation of its somatic activity in natural populations of Drosophila simulans have shown contradictory results (latitudinal clines of divergent orientations or no apparent structure). To try and resolve these inconsistencies, we gathered all available data on the mariner somatic activity of worldwide natural populations. This includes previously published results by different groups and also new data. The correlations between the level of activity and several geoclimatic factors were tested. Although no general effect of temperature was found, a relationship with the invasion history was detected. It was also shown that recent invasive populations have a higher level of activity than the putative ancestral ones. Our results strongly suggest that variability of the mariner somatic activity among natural populations of D. simulans is mainly due to populational and historical factors probably related to the recent world colonization of this species. Indeed, this activity is correlated to the main route out of Africa (the Nile route) and the recent colonization of continents such as Australia and South America.},

The allelic states of all homologous gene copies in a population are determined by the genealogical and mutational history of these copies. The coalescent approach is based on the realization that the genealogy is usually easier to model backward in time, and that selectively neutral mutations can then be superimposed afterwards. A wide range of biological phenomena can be modeled using this approach.  Whereas almost all of classical population genetics considers the future of a population given a starting point, the coalescent considers the present, while taking the past into account. This allows the calculation of probabilities of sample configurations under the stationary distribution of various population genetic models, and makes full likelihood analysis of polymorphism data possible. It also leads to extremely efficient computer algorithms for generating simulated data from such distributions, data which can then be compared with observations as a form of exploratory data analysis.},

Communities of soil microorganisms perform critical functions: controlling climate, enhancing crop production, and remediation of environmental contamination. Microbial communities in the oral cavity and the gut are of high biomedical interest. Understanding and harnessing the function of these communities is difficult: artificial microbial communities in the laboratory become unstable because of "winner-takes-all" competition among species. We constructed a community of three different species of wild-type soil bacteria with syntrophic interactions using a microfluidic device to control spatial structure and chemical communication. We found that defined microscale spatial structure is both necessary and sufficient for the stable coexistence of interacting bacterial species in the synthetic community. A mathematical model describes how spatial structure can balance the competition and positive interactions within the community, even when the rates of production and consumption of nutrients by species are mismatched, by exploiting nonlinearities of these processes. These findings provide experimental and modeling evidence for a class of communities that require microscale spatial structure for stability, and these results predict that controlling spatial structure may enable harnessing the function of natural and synthetic multispecies communities in the laboratory.},

abstract = {Ecosystem models help us understand the mechanisms that influence ecosystem health indicators. However, if they are too complex, these mechanisms can be difficult to identify. On the other hand, if they are too simple the mechanisms may be distorted or even absent. Determining an appropriate level of model complexity is therefore desirable. This paper introduces two model simplification methods that are based on the sensitivity of performance measures to model rates and components. The first method identifies rates that have little influence on the performance measures and subsequently eliminates them. The second identifies, for a given performance measure, state variables that can be made constant. The methods can be implemented automatically, so that familiarity with the model is not required a priori. Demonstrating with a biogeochemical model of Port Phillip Bay, Australia, we find that significant reduction in model complexity is possible, including reductions in model order. Also, the process of implementing the methods reveals insights into the system that were not obvious beforehand. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved},

abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs), represent a large fraction of the eukaryotic genome. In Drosophila melanogaster, about 20{\%} of the genome corresponds to such middle repetitive DNA dispersed sequences. A fraction of TEs is composed of elements showing a retrovirus-like structure, the LTR-retrotransposons, the first TEs to be described in the Drosophila genome. Interestingly, in D. melanogaster embryonic immortal cell culture genomes the copy number of these LTR-retrotransposons was revealed to be higher than the copy number in the Drosophila genome, presumably as the result of transposition of some copies to new genomic locations [Potter, S.S., Brorein Jr., W.J., Dunsmuir, P., Rubin, G.M., 1979. Transposition of elements of the 412, copia and 297 dispersed repeated gene families in Drosophila. Cell 17, 415-427; Junakovic, N., Di Franco, C., Best-Belpomme, M., Echalier, G., 1988. On the transposition of copia-like nomadic elements in cultured Drosophila cells. Chromosoma 97, 212-218]. This suggests that so many transpositions modified the genome organisation and consequently the expression of targeted genes. To understand what has directed the transposition of TEs in Drosophila cell culture genomes, a search to identify the newly transposed copies was undertaken using 1731, a LTR-retrotransposon. A comparison between 1731 full-length elements found in the fly sequenced genome (y1; cn1 bw1, sp1 stock) and 1731 full-length elements amplified by PCR in the two cell line was done. The resulting data provide evidence that all 1731 neocopies were derived from a single copy slightly active in the Drosophila genome and subsequently strongly activated in cultured cells; and that this active copy is related to a newly evolved genomic variant (Kalmykova, A.I., et al., 2004. Selective expansion of the newly evolved genomic variants of retrotransposon 1731 in the Drosophila genomes. Mol. Biol. Evol. 21, 2281-2289). Moreover, neocopies are shown to be inserted in different sets of genes in the two cell lines suggesting they might be involved in the biological and physiological differences observed between Kc and S2 cell lines. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Most studies of ecological models focus exclusively on the asymptotic stability properties of equilibria. However, short-term transient effects can be important, and can in some cases dominate the dynamics seen in experimental or field studies. The reactivity of a stable equilibrium point measures the potential for short-term amplification of perturbations. The reactivity of a fixed point in a discrete-time system is given by the natural logarithm of the largest singular value of the Jacobian matrix of the linear approximation near the fixed point. If the reactivity is positive, the fixed point is said to be reactive. Here we examine the reactivity of discrete-time predator–prey models and density-dependent matrix population models. We find reactivity to be common (but not universal) and sometimes extremely high. Predator–prey or food web models that include a predator whose per-capita growth rate depends on the density of its prey, but not on its own density, are a special case. Any positive equilibrium of such a model must be reactive. Reactivity of discrete-time models depends on the timing of the census relative to the timing of reproduction. Perturbation analysis of singular values can be used to calculate the sensitivity and elasticity of reactivity to changes in model parameters. We conclude that transient amplification of perturbations should be a common ecological phenomenon. The interaction of these transient effects with the asymptotic nonlinear dynamics warrants further study.},

abstract = {We consider the effects of parameter perturbations on a density-dependent population at equilibrium. Such perturbations change the dominant eigenvalue lambda of the projection matrix evaluated at the equilibrium as well as the equilibrium itself. We show that, regardless of the functional form of density dependence, the sensitivity of lambda is equal to the sensitivity of an effective equilibrium density (N) over tilde, which is a weighted combination of the equilibrium stage densities. The weights measure the contributions of each stage to density dependence and their effects on demography. Thus, (N) over tilde is in general more relevant than total density, which simply adds all stages regardless of their ecological properties. As log lambda is the invasion exponent, our results show that successful invasion will increase (N) over tilde, and that an evolutionary stable strategy will maximize (N) over tilde. Our results imply that eigenvalue sensitivity analysis of a population projection matrix that is evaluated near equilibrium can give useful information about the sensitivity of the equilibrium population, even if no data on density dependence are available.},

abstract = {Population scientists concerned with long-term trends in human mortality ought to be interested in skeletal samples from extinct communities. Such samples are, in principle, the only possible source of information for most pre-industrial populations lacking written records — by far the most common kind of human community that has ever existed. Samples of skeletons provide two broad classes of information of potential interest to demographers and other population specialists: frequency counts of bony lesions that may reveal something about pathological processes active in the population, and data on ages-at-death from which age patterns of mortality may be inferred. Of these, the latter class of information has generally been deemed to be the less problematic. It has been assumed that skeletal age-at-death can be estimated well enough, albeit with some inevitable degree of error, to support a few crude but revealing statistics such as mean age-at-death, life expectancies, and age-specific mortality rates. And so for decades it has been considered perfectly acceptable to use skeletal data to compute ‘‘life tables'', the traditional demographic tool for investigating age patterns of mortality. All that is needed, in this view, are a few simple modifications of standard life table techniques, modifications that were laid down 30 years ago by Acsa´ di and Nemeske´ ri (1970:60—65)....},

@article{Krebs2001,
abstract = {I n 1831 the manager of a Hudson's Bay Company post in northern Ontario wrote to the head office in London. The local Ojibway Indians were starving,he reported,because of a scarcity of “rabbits,”and they were unable to trap for furs because they spent all their time fishing for food (Winter- halder 1980). These shortages of so-called rabbits,which ap- parently occurred approximately every 10 years, are regularly mentioned in Canadian historical documents from the 18th and 19th centuries.Those rabbits were in fact snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), and their 10-year cycle is one of the most intriguing features of the ecology of the boreal forest. Ten-year cycles were first analyzed quantitatively when wildlife biologists began to plot the fur trading records of Hudson's Bay Company during the early 1900s. The Hud- son's Bay Company, established in 1671, kept meticulous records of the numbers of furs traded from different posts spread across Canada. The most famous time series drawn together from those records was that of Canada lynx (Elton and Nicholson 1942; Figure 1).The lynx is a specialist preda- tor of snowshoe hares, and the rise and fall in lynx numbers mirrors,with a slight time lag, the rise and fall of snowshoe hare populations across the boreal region. The spectacular cycles of snowshoe hares and their preda- tors have captured the attention of biologists as well as his- torians. These cycles are highlighted in virtually all ecology texts and are often cited as one of the few examples of Lotka-Volterra predator–prey equations, a simple model which shows never-ending oscillations in the numbers of predators and their prey.Cycles seem to violate the implicit assumption of many ecologists that there is a balance in na- ture, and anyone living in the boreal forest would be hard pressed to recognize a balance among the boom and bust in nature's economy.The challenge to biologists has been to un- derstand the mechanisms behind these cycles,which has not been easy. One cycle lasts 10 years, and few PhD students or researchers wish to take 10 years to obtain n = 1. Fortunately, over the last 40 years ecologists working in Alberta, the Yukon Territory, and Alaska have put together an array of studies that have resolved most, but not all, of the enigmas behind these cycles (Keith 1990, Boutin et al. 1995). To understand any fluctuating population,one must first know in detail the mechanisms of changes in births, deaths, and movements that are the proximate causes of the changes in numbers. Before we describe these details, we should note that these 10-year hare cycles tend to occur in synchrony across broad regions. Indeed, hares across most of Canada and Alaska reached a peak in 1997–1999 during the most re- cent cycle.We explain the reasons behind this synchrony be- low, but let us note here that movements of hares cannot explain these population changes via immigration or emi- gration.Movements on a local level might be important,but at the regional level all populations rise and fall in unison. Population changes must be driven by changes in births and deaths.},

abstract = {Dynamic models of quantitative (polygenic) characters are more generally applicable in the analysis of life history evolution than are static optimization methods or one and two locus genetic models. A dynamic theory of life history evolution is derived by synthesizing population demography with quantitative genetics. In a population under weak selection with a nearly stable age distribution, the relative fitness of individuals with a particular life history phenotype can be approximated as an average of age-specific relative fecundity and mortality rates, weighted respectively by the present productivity and future reproductive value of each age-class. An adaptive topography is constructed showing that, with phenotype- and age-specific fecundity and mortality rates constant in time, evolution of the mean life history maximizes the intrinsic rate of increase of a population. However, the rate and direction of evolution in response to selection are strongly influenced by genetic correlations among characters. Negative genetic correlations among major components of fitness are often obscured phenotypically by positive environmental correlations, but commonly constitute the ultimate constraint on life history evolution, as illustrated by artificial selection experiments. Methods are suggested for measuring selective forces and evolutionary constraints that effect life history characters in natural populations.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. A transient behavior analysis of the population dynamics of an herbaceous plant spe-cies (teasel, Dipsacus sylvestris Huds.) was developed to contrast with the long-term limiting response analysis of an earlier study. Following the arrival of a cohort of seeds at a site, there is typically an immediate increase in the rate of growth of rosette cover and the rate of seed production, followed by a decline several years later. This decline, caused by shifts in the stage structure of the population, may be critical in determining success or failure of a colonization episode. Simple calculations of the rate at which a population of Dipsacus might expand in space show that density effects on numbers of adult plants will become important in 15-20 yr. This conclusion supports the use of transient analysis in addition to the standard limiting behavior analysis, which assumes a constant environment over long time intervals. The reproductive value of Dipsacus increases exponentially from one stage to the next, and as a power function of accumulated biomass. A hint of a sigmoid response of reproductive value to biomass suggests that the transition from the vegetative rosette to the flowering stage may have evolved in response to the rate of accumulation of reproductive value as plant biomass increases. The response of Dipsacus to a variety of hypothetical changes in life history parameters was examined. A general method of calculating the sensitivity of population growth rate (Xm) was devel-oped; when applied to the teasel model it showed that XA is most sensitive to changes in the growth and reproduction of early stages. Delayed seed germination is not important to long-term population growth; the complete elimination of delayed germination from the model caused no more than a 4{\%} decrease in Xm. It may be much more important in terms of transient behavior; elimination of delayed germination depressed the initial decline in rosette cover by up to 72{\%}. If this decline delays the colonization process, the most important populational effect of delayed germination would be an increase in the probability that an attempted colonization will be successful. We also examined the optimality of the current biennial life history of Dipsacus, relative to both annual and perennial alternatives. The shift to an annual strategy is rendered suboptimal by the low probability of germination and survival of seeds relative to the probability of survival of rosettes, and by the high growth potential of rosettes. This growth potential increases the energy available for seed production by an order of magnitude over the hypothetical annual strategy, greatly increasing the reproductive value of the biennial flowering plants. The switch to a perennial habit is suboptimal because of the cost, in annual reproductive output, of maintaining a perennial flowering plant. This effect is greatest in rapidly growing populations. There seem to be no important differences between the transient and the limiting behavior analyses of life history optimality. Our direct, rather than inferred, demonstration of the optimality of teasel's life history supports the development of current theory based on optimality assumptions.},

abstract = {Gene phylogenies provide a rich source of information about the way evolution shapes genomes, populations, and phenotypes. In addition to substitutions, evolutionary events such as gene duplication and loss (as well as horizontal transfer) play a major role in gene evolution, and many phylogenetic models have been developed in order to reconstruct and study these events. However, these models typically make the simplifying assumption that population-related effects such as incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) are negligible. While this assumption may have been reasonable in some settings, it has become increasingly problematic as increased genome sequencing has led to denser phylogenies, where effects such as ILS are more prominent. To address this challenge, we present a new probabilistic model, DLCoal, that defines gene duplication and loss in a population setting, such that coalescence and ILS can be directly addressed. Interestingly, this model implies that in addition to the usual gene tree and species tree, there exists a third tree, the locus tree, which will likely have many applications. Using this model, we develop the first general reconciliation method that accurately infers gene duplications and losses in the presence of ILS, and we show its improved inference of orthologs, paralogs, duplications, and losses for a variety of clades, including flies, fungi, and primates. Also, our simulations show that gene duplications increase the frequency of ILS, further illustrating the importance of a joint model. Going forward, we believe that this unified model can offer insights to questions in both phylogenetics and population genetics.},

abstract = {Laminin-332 is a major component of the dermo-epidermal skin basement membrane and maintains skin integrity. The transduction of mechanical force into electrical signals by sensory endings in the skin requires mechanosensitive channels. We found that mouse epidermal keratinocytes produce a matrix that is inhibitory for sensory mechanotransduction and that the active molecular component is laminin-332. Substrate-bound laminin-332 specifically suppressed one type of mechanosensitive current (rapidly adapting) independently of integrin-receptor activation. This mechanotransduction suppression could be exerted locally and was mediated by preventing the formation of protein tethers necessary for current activation. We also found that laminin-332 could locally control sensory axon branching behavior. Loss of laminin-332 in humans led to increased sensory terminal branching and may lead to a de-repression of mechanosensitive currents. These previously unknown functions for this matrix molecule may explain some of the extreme pain experienced by individuals with epidermolysis bullosa who are deficient in laminin-332.},

TOPALS models the relationship between the age-specific fertility rates to be fitted and the standard age schedule by a linear spline. This paper uses TOPALS for smoothing fertility age profiles for 30 European countries. The use of TOPALS to create scenarios of the future level and age pattern of fertility is illustrated by applying the method to project future fertility rates for six European countries.},

Nursing home residents reported higher death anxiety than others; women and uneducated participants reported greater levels of fear of death and dying than others. There were no differences based on religiosity. Death anxiety was related to gender and education for elderly living in the community, but social support and self-esteem were additional correlates for those living in nursing homes. The results of this study indicate that fostering a sense that one has a supportive social and familial network is important in decreasing death and dying anxiety among elderly Arab people. It would also be beneficial to provide information and knowledge that might relieve some of the anxiety they experience.},

abstract = {Language acquisition maps linguistic experience, primary linguistic data (PLD), onto linguistic knowledge, a grammar. Classically, computational models of language acquisition assume a single target grammar and one PLD source, the central question being whether the target grammar can be acquired from the PLD. However, real-world learners confront populations with variation, i.e., multiple target grammars and PLDs. Removing this idealization has inspired a new class of population-based language acquisition models. This paper contrasts 2 such models. In the first, iterated learning (IL), each learner receives PLD from one target grammar but different learners can have different targets. In the second, social learning (SL), each learner receives PLD from possibly multiple targets, e.g., from 2 parents. We demonstrate that these 2 models have radically different evolutionary consequences. The IL model is dynamically deficient in 2 key respects. First, the IL model admits only linear dynamics and so cannot describe phase transitions, attested rapid changes in languages over time. Second, the IL model cannot properly describe the stability of languages over time. In contrast, the SL model leads to nonlinear dynamics, bifurcations, and possibly multiple equilibria and so suffices to model both the case of stable language populations, mixtures of more than 1 language, as well as rapid language change. The 2 models also make distinct, empirically testable predictions about language change. Using historical data, we show that the SL model more faithfully replicates the dynamics of the evolution of Middle English.},

abstract = {Central Africa is currently peopled by numerous sedentary agriculturalist populations neighboring the largest group of mobile hunter-gatherers, the Pygmies [1-3]. Although archeological remains attest to Homo sapiens' presence in the Congo Basin for at least 30,000 years, the demographic history of these groups, including divergence and admixture, remains widely unknown [4-6]. Moreover, it is still debated whether common history or convergent adaptation to a forest environment resulted in the short stature characterizing the pygmies [2, 7]. We genotyped 604 individuals at 28 autosomal tetranucleotide microsatellite loci in 12 nonpygmy and 9 neighboring pygmy populations. We found a high level of genetic heterogeneity among Western Central African pygmies, as well as evidence of heterogeneous levels of asymmetrical gene flow from nonpygmies to pygmies, consistent with the variable sociocultural barriers against intermarriages. Using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods [8], we compared several historical scenarios. The most likely points toward a unique ancestral pygmy population that diversified approximately 2800 years ago, contemporarily with the Neolithic expansion of nonpygmy agriculturalists [9, 10]. Our results show that recent isolation, genetic drift, and heterogeneous admixture enabled a rapid and substantial genetic differentiation among Western Central African pygmies. Such an admixture pattern is consistent with the various sociocultural behaviors related to intermariages between pygmies and nonpygmies.},

abstract = {Most studies of European genetic diversity have focused on large-scale variation and interpretations based on events in prehistory, but migrations and invasions in historical times could also have had profound effects on the genetic landscape. The Iberian Peninsula provides a suitable region for examination of the demographic impact of such recent events, because its complex recent history has involved the long-term residence of two very different populations with distinct geographical origins and their own particular cultural and religious characteristics-North African Muslims and Sephardic Jews. To address this issue, we analyzed Y chromosome haplotypes, which provide the necessary phylogeographic resolution, in 1140 males from the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands. Admixture analysis based on binary and Y-STR haplotypes indicates a high mean proportion of ancestry from North African (10.6{\%}) and Sephardic Jewish (19.8{\%}) sources. Despite alternative possible sources for lineages ascribed a Sephardic Jewish origin, these proportions attest to a high level of religious conversion (whether voluntary or enforced), driven by historical episodes of social and religious intolerance, that ultimately led to the integration of descendants. In agreement with the historical record, analysis of haplotype sharing and diversity within specific haplogroups suggests that the Sephardic Jewish component is the more ancient. The geographical distribution of North African ancestry in the peninsula does not reflect the initial colonization and subsequent withdrawal and is likely to result from later enforced population movement-more marked in some regions than in others-plus the effects of genetic drift. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract = {Prey in natural communities are usually shared by many predator species. How predators coexist while competing for the same prey is one of the fundamental questions in ecology. Here, we show that competing predator species may not only coexist on a single prey but even help each other to persist if they specialize on different life history stages of the prey. By changing the prey size distribution, a predator species may in fact increase the amount of prey available for its competitor. Surprisingly, a predator may not be able to persist at all unless its competitor is also present. The competitor thus significantly increases the range of conditions for which a particular predator can persist. This "emergent facilitation" is a long-term, population-level effect that results from asymmetric increases in the rate of prey maturation and reproduction when predation relaxes competition among prey. Emergent facilitation explains observations of correlated increases of predators on small and large conspecific prey as well as concordance in their distribution patterns. Our results suggest that emergent facilitation may promote the occurrence of complex, stable, community food webs and that persistence of these communities could critically depend on diversity within predator guilds.},

abstract = {Auditory and perceptual processing of songs are required for a number of behaviors in songbirds such as vocal learning, territorial defense, mate selection and individual recognition. These neural processes are accompanied by increased expression of a few transcription factors, particularly in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), an auditory forebrain area believed to play a key role in auditory learning and song discrimination. However, these molecular changes are presumably part of a larger, yet uncharacterized, protein regulatory network. In order to gain further insight into this network, we performed two-dimensional differential in-gel expression (2D-DIGE) experiments, extensive protein quantification analyses, and tandem mass spectrometry in the NCM of adult songbirds hearing novel songs. A subset of proteins was selected for immunocytochemistry in NCM sections to confirm the 2D-DIGE findings and to provide additional quantitative and anatomical information. Using these methodologies, we found that stimulation of freely behaving birds with conspecific songs did not significantly impact the NCM proteome 5 min after stimulus onset. However, following 1 and 3 h of stimulation, a significant number of proteins were consistently regulated in NCM. These proteins spanned a range of functional categories that included metabolic enzymes, cytoskeletal molecules, and proteins involved in neurotransmitter secretion and calcium binding. Our findings suggest that auditory processing of vocal communication signals in freely behaving songbirds triggers a cascade of protein regulatory events that are dynamically regulated through activity-dependent changes in calcium levels.},

abstract = {Rabies is a fatal neurological pathogen that is a persistent problem throughout the developing world where it is spread primarily by domestic dogs. Although the disease has been extensively studied in wildlife populations in Europe and North America, the dynamics of rabies in domestic dog populations has been almost entirely neglected. Here, we demonstrate that rabies epidemics in southern and eastern Africa cycle with a period of 3-6 years and show significant synchrony across the region. The observed period is shorter than predictions based on epidemiological parameters for rabies in domestic dogs. We find evidence that rabies prevention measures, including vaccination, are affected by disease prevalence and show that a simple model with intervention responses can capture observed disease periodicity and host dynamics. We suggest that movement of infectious or latent animals combined with coordinated control responses may be important in coupling populations and generating synchrony at the continental scale. These findings have important implications for rabies prediction and control: large-scale synchrony and the importance of intervention responses suggest that control of canine rabies in Africa will require sustained efforts coordinated across political boundaries.},

abstract = {Transposable elements are often considered parasitic DNA sequences, able to invade the genome of their host thanks to their self-replicating ability. This colonization process has been extensively studied, both theoretically and experimentally, but their long-term coevolution with the genomes is still poorly understood. In this work, we aim to challenge previous population genetics models by considering features of transposable elements as quantitative, rather than discrete, variables. We also describe more realistic transposable element dynamics by accounting for the variability of the insertion effect, from deleterious to adaptive, as well as mutations leading to a loss of transposition activity and to nonautonomous copies. Individual-based simulations of the behavior of a transposable-element family over several thousand generations show different ways in which active or inactive copies can be maintained for a very long time. Results reveal an unexpected impact of genetic drift on the "junk DNA" content of the genome and strongly question the likelihood of the sustainable long-term stable transposition-selection equilibrium on which numerous previous works were based.},

abstract = {Many animal species live in groups. Group living may increase exploitation competition within the group, and variation among groups in intra-group competition intensity could induce life-history variability among groups. Models of physiologically structured populations generally predict single generation cycles, driven by exploitation competition within and between generations. We expect that life-history variability and habitat heterogeneity induced by group living may affect such competition-driven population dynamics. In this study, we vary the gregariousness (the tendency to aggregate in groups) of a size-structured consumer population in a spatially explicit environment. The consumer has limited mobility, and moves according to a probabilistic movement process. We study the effects on the population dynamics, as mediated through the resource and the life-history of the consumer. We find that high gregariousness leads to large spatial resource variation, and highly variable individual life-history, resulting in highly stochastic population dynamics. At reduced gregariousness, life-history of consumers synchronizes, habitat heterogeneity is reduced, and single generation cycles appear. We expect this pattern to occur for any group living organism with limited mobility. Our results indicate that constraints set by population dynamical feedback may be an important aspect in understanding group living in nature. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Randomly moving but self-propelled agents, such as Escherichia coli bacteria, are expected to fill a volume homogeneously. However, we show that when a population of bacteria is exposed to a microfabricated wall of funnel-shaped openings, the random motion of bacteria through the openings is rectified by tracking (trapping) of the swimming bacteria along the funnel wall. This leads to a buildup of the concentration of swimming cells on the narrow opening side of the funnel wall but no concentration of nonswimming cells. Similarly, we show that a series of such funnel walls functions as a multistage pump and can increase the concentration of motile bacteria exponentially with the number of walls. The funnel wall can be arranged along arbitrary shapes and cause the bacteria to form well-defined patterns. The funnel effect may also have implications on the transport and distribution of motile microorganisms in irregular confined environments, such as porous media, wet soil, or biological tissue, or act as a selection pressure in evolution experiments.},

abstract = {Evolutionary studies of human behavior have emphasized the importance of kin selection in explaining social institutions and fitness outcomes. Our relatives can nevertheless be competitors as well as sources of altruism. This is particularly likely when there is local competition over resources, where conflict can lead to strife among nondispersing relatives, reducing or even negating the effects of relatedness on promoting altruism. Here, I present demographic data on a land-limited human population, utilizing large within-population variation in land ownership to determine the interactions between local resource competition and the benefits of kin in enhancing child survival, a key component of fitness in this population. As predicted, wealth affects the extent of kin altruism, in that paternal relatives (specifically father's brothers) appear to buffer young children from mortality much more effectively in rich than in poor households. This interaction effect is interpreted as evidence that the extent of nepotism among humans depends critically on resource availability. Further unanticipated evidence that maternal kin play a role in buffering children from mortality in situations where paternal kin control few resources speaks to the important role that specific local circumstance plays in shaping kin contributions to child welfare. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {There are multiple approaches to sensitivity analysis used to identify the age- (or stage-) specific rate of reproduction or survival that most affects population growth-all of which involve evaluating effects on {\OE}{\textordfeminine}, the dominant eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix. Management recommendations generated by these approaches can be difficult to determine, in part because results are valid only for populations with stable age distributions (i.e., the age structure is constant across years). Although these analytical approaches can identify the quickest way to increase population size to carrying capacity, they cannot identify best management options for short-term goals such as increasing population size above some critical value. We present a perturbation analysis-Vital Rate Sensitivity Analysis (VRSA)-to identify the vital rate that most limits population growth over any specified period by determining which vital rate has the greatest effect on population growth. The VRSA is effective for stable and nonstable age distributions, differentiates optimal short- and long-term management options, can incorporate stochasticity in vital rates, and can differentiate efficacy of alternative management strategies. In addition to being able to compare effects of incremental or specific changes in vital rates, VRSA can be used to compare specific management alternatives that affect single or multiple vital rates. We illustrate use of VRSA for a variety of management alternatives and hypothetical age-structures using demographic data from the literature for greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) and red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis). We also present a method, using Monte Carlo simulation, for measuring robustness of VRSA results. Under all of our management scenarios for greater prairie-chickens, we found juvenile survival to be the most sensitive vital rate for the specific comparisons made. For red-cockaded woodpeckers, the most sensitive vital rate differed by management scenario and confidence was higher for larger populations. Results for both species might change given other conditions and/or age structures. The VRSA should be an effective tool for wildlife managers who want to compare alternative management strategies to increase population size. A downloadable Excel spread sheet for calculating VRSA for a life-table is available at http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/faculty/reed/software.html.},

abstract = {The majority of data sets in the geosciences are obtained from observations and measurements of natural systems, rather than in the laboratory. These data sets are often full of gaps, due to to the conditions under which the measurements are made. Missing data give rise to various problems, for example in spectral estimation or in specifying boundary conditions for numerical models. Here we use Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to fill the gaps in several types of data sets. For a univariate record, our procedure uses only temporal correlations in the data to fill in the missing points. For a multivariate record, multi-channel SSA (M-SSA) takes advantage of both spatial and temporal correlations. We iteratively produce estimates of missing data points, which are then used to compute a self-consistent lag-covariance matrix; cross-validation allows us to optimize the window width and number of dominant SSA or M-SSA modes to fill the gaps. The optimal parameters of our procedure depend on the distribution in time (and space) of the missing data, as well as on the variance distribution between oscillatory modes and noise. The algorithm is demonstrated on synthetic examples, as well as on data sets from oceanography, hydrology, atmospheric sciences, and space physics: global sea-surface temperature, flood-water records of the Nile River, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and satellite observations of relativistic electrons.},

abstract = {Transposable elements are one of the major components of genomes. Some copies are fully efficient; i.e., they are able to produce the proteins needed for their own transposition, and they can move and duplicate into the genome. Other copies are mutated. They may have lost their moving ability, their coding capacity, or both, thus becoming pseudogenes slowly eliminated from the genome through deletions and natural selection. Little is known about the dynamics of such mutant elements, particularly concerning their interactions with autonomous copies. To get a better understanding of the transposable elements' evolution after their initial invasion, we have designed a population genetics model of transposable elements dynamics including mutants or nonfunctional sequences. We have particularly focused on the case where these sequences are nonautonomous elements, known to be able to use the transposition machinery produced by the autonomous ones. The results show that such copies generally prevent the system from achieving a stable transposition-selection equilibrium and that nonautonomous elements can invade the system at the expense of autonomous ones. The resulting dynamics are mainly cyclic, which highlights the similarities existing between genomic selfish DNA sequences and host-parasite systems.},

abstract = {Wild cherry (Prunus avium L.), a partially asexual self-incompatible forest tree, shows heterozygote excess, which is a poorly studied phenomenon. In three natural populations, we found significant heterozygote excess at almost all investigated loci (eight microsatellites and markers for the self-incompatibility locus). We examined four hypotheses to account for this observed heterozygote excess. First, negative F(IS) can result from a lack of selfed progeny in small populations of outcrossing species. A second explanation for negative F(IS) is selection during the life cycle of the most heterozygous individuals. A third explanation is negative assortative mating when reproduction occurs between individuals bearing phenotypes more dissimilar than by chance. The last explanation for negative F(IS) relies on asexual reproduction. Expectations for each hypothesis were tested using empirical data. Patterns of F(IS) differed among loci. Nevertheless, our experimental results did not confirm the small sample size hypothesis. Although one locus is probably under a hitch-hiking effect from the SI locus, we rejected the effect of the self-incompatibility locus for the genome as a whole. Similarly, although one locus showed a clear pattern consistent with the selection of heterozygous individuals, the heterosis effect over the whole genome was rejected. Finally, our results revealed that clonality probably explains significant negative F(IS) in wild cherry populations when considering all individuals. More theoretical effort is needed to develop expectations and hypotheses, and test them in the case of species combining self-incompatibility and partially asexual reproduction.},

abstract = {Transposable elements are genomic parasites that replicate independently from their hosts. They harm their hosts by causing mutations or genomic rearrangements, and most organisms have evolved various mechanisms to suppress their activity. The evolutionary dynamics of transposons in insects, fish, birds and mammals are dramatically different. Mammalian genomes contain few, very abundant but relatively inactive transposon strains, while Drosophila and fish species harbour diverse strains, which typically have low abundance but are much more virulent. We hypothesise that the variation in the diversity and activity of transposable elements between various animal genomes is caused by the differences in the host defence mechanisms against transposon activity. In recent years RNAi, a mechanism capable of gene, virus and transposon silencing has been discovered. We model RNAi as a density dependant mechanism of defence, which can cause competition among transposons depending on its specificity, and test its predictions using the complete Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Fugu rubripes, chicken, mouse, rat and human genome sequences.},

abstract = {I propose a methodology of sensitivity analysis applicable to complex process-based models. In application and discussion of this methodology, a model is conceived as a mechanism that is composed by multiple interacting processes. In this approach, model structure is explicitly investigated by analyzing the relationship that exists between process interactions and the emergent properties of the model. The methodology focuses on sensitivity analysis at the process level; and studies how process level uncertainty propagates through the network of modeled processes, affecting the dynamics generated through the interacting processes as well as the final model outcome. The information provided by this analysis can be used to ensure that the way in which the model operates resembles the phenomena being modeled, when uncertainties in processes are considered. It allows evaluation of the quality of a model and increases the confidence in model results. Some of the advantages of this approach are that it allows handling high levels of complexity by abstracting information at the process level, it facilitates the interpretation of model behavior and it provides information that allows exploration of how uncertainty in processes might affect model output. I illustrate the method through an example using the vegetation model Biome-{\{}BGC.{\}}},

We use the artificial life methodology of building a society of artificial agents, equipped with motor, perceptual and cognitive systems that are generic and have a realistic complexity. We demonstrate that agents, playing the “imitation game,” build shared syllable systems and show how these syllable systems relate to existing human syllable systems. Detailed experiments study the learnability of the self-organized syllable systems. In particular, we reproduce the critical period effect and the artificial language learning effect without the need for innate biases which specify explicitly in advance the form of possible phonological structures. The ability of children agents to learn syllable systems is explained by the cultural evolutionary history of these syllable systems, which were selected for learnability.},

Using a simple model we show how information can be transferred within groups both without signalling and when group members do not know which individuals, if any, have information. We reveal that the larger the group the smaller the proportion of informed individuals needed to guide the group, and that only a very small proportion of informed individuals is required to achieve great accuracy. We also demonstrate how groups can make consensus decisions, even though informed individuals do not know whether they are in a majority or minority, how the quality of their information compares with that of others, or even whether there are any other informed individuals. Our model provides new insights into the mechanisms of effective leadership and decision-making in biological systems.},

That is, development is robust to changes in genotype and environment. It has been claimed that this robustness, termed canalization, evolves because of long-term natural selection for optimal phenotypes. We show that the developmental process, here modeled as a network of interacting transcriptional regulators, constrains the genetic system to produce canalization, even without selection toward an optimum. The extent of canalization, measured as the insensitivity to mutation of a network's equilibrium state, depends on the complexity of the network, such that more highly connected networks evolve to be more canalized. We argue that canalization may be an inevitable consequence of complex developmental-genetic processes and thus requires no explanation in terms of evolution to suppress phenotypic variation.},

abstract = {Regular fluctuations in population density, both periodic and chaotic, are found in a variety of species in nature, including boreal mammals, insect herbivores, grouse and partridge, and salmon. Although the exact causes of these cycles remain undetermined for most species, they generally involve strongly nonlinear trophic and competitive interac- tions among a small number of species. Because of these nonlinearities, it is difficult to extrapolate the effects of global environmental change on the dynamics of any par- ticular population. However, if communities become less diverse and conditions change so as to increase many species' intrinsic growth rates, then cyclic and chaotic population dynamics may become more common.},

abstract = {Words in human language interact in sentences in non-random ways, and allow humans to construct an astronomic variety of sentences from a limited number of discrete units. This construction process is extremely fast and robust. The co-occurrence of words in sentences reflects language organization in a subtle manner that can be described in terms of a graph of word interactions. Here, we show that such graphs display two important features recently found in a disparate number of complex systems. (i) The so called small-world effect. In particular, the average distance between two words, d (i.e. the average minimum number of links to be crossed from an arbitrary word to another), is shown to be d approximately equal to 2-3, even though the human brain can store many thousands. (ii) A scale-free distribution of degrees. The known pronounced effects of disconnecting the most connected vertices in such networks can be identified in some language disorders. These observations indicate some unexpected features of language organization that might reflect the evolutionary and social history of lexicons and the origins of their flexibility and combinatorial nature.},

abstract = {Clinal patterns of autosomal genetic diversity within Europe have been interpreted in previous studies in terms of a Neolithic demic diffusion model for the spread of agriculture; in contrast, studies using mtDNA have traced many founding lineages to the Paleolithic and have not shown strongly clinal variation. We have used 11 human Y-chromosomal biallelic polymorphisms, defining 10 haplogroups, to analyze a sample of 3,616 Y chromosomes belonging to 47 European and circum-European populations. Patterns of geographic differentiation are highly nonrandom, and, when they are assessed using spatial autocorrelation analysis, they show significant clines for five of six haplogroups analyzed. Clines for two haplogroups, representing 45{\%} of the chromosomes, are continentwide and consistent with the demic diffusion hypothesis. Clines for three other haplogroups each have different foci and are more regionally restricted and are likely to reflect distinct population movements, including one from north of the Black Sea. Principal-components analysis suggests that populations are related primarily on the basis of geography, rather than on the basis of linguistic affinity. This is confirmed in Mantel tests, which show a strong and highly significant partial correlation between genetics and geography but a low, nonsignificant partial correlation between genetics and language. Genetic-barrier analysis also indicates the primacy of geography in the shaping of patterns of variation. These patterns retain a strong signal of expansion from the Near East but also suggest that the demographic history of Europe has been complex and influenced by other major population movements, as well as by linguistic and geographic heterogeneities and the effects of drift.},

The tertiary structures of the second domains of EF-G and EF-Tu are nearly identical, but the relative placement of the first two domains in EF-G--GDP resembles that seen in EF-Tu--GTP, not EF-Tu--GDP.

abstract = {The distribution in the human genome of the largest family of mobile elements, the Alu sequences, has been investigated for the past 30 years, and the vast majority of Alu sequences were shown to have the highest density in GC-rich isochores. Ten years ago, it was discovered, however, that the small "youngest" (most recently transposed) Alu families had a strikingly different distribution compared with the "old" families. This raised the question as to how this change took place in evolution. We solved what was considered to be a "mystery" by 1) revisiting our previous results on the integration and stability of retroviral sequences, and 2) assessing the densities of acceptor sites TTTT/AA in isochore families. We could conclude 1) that the open state of chromatin structure plays a crucial role in allowing not only the initial integration of retroviral sequences but also that of the youngest Alu sequences, and 2) that the distribution of old Alus can be explained as due to Alu sequences being unstable in the GC-poor isochores but stable in the compositionally matching GC-rich isochores, again in line with what happens in the case of retroviral sequences.},

abstract = {Tilman's theory predicts the outcome of competition between two consumers sharing two resources on the basis of the shape of zero net-growth isoclines (ZNGIs). In his theory, intraspecific differences in resource use are not accounted for. Here we extend this theory to include situations where organisms undergo ontogenetic diet shifts, as these characterize the life histories of many species. In a situation that without diet shifts would lead to neutral coexistence of consumer species, we investigate whether ontogenetic diet shifts lead to niche partitioning. We analyze a model describing competition for two resources between two competitors with distinctive diets over ontogeny, using copepods (showing ontogenetic diet shifts) and daphnids (not showing ontogenetic diet shifts) as appropriate representatives. We show that an ontogenetic diet shift affects the shape of the ZNGI, changing it from reflecting perfectly substitutable resources to reflecting essential resources. Furthermore, we show that resource supply determines population stage structure and stage-dependent resource consumption in copepods and influences the competitive outcome with daphnids. In particular, we show that in itself, an ontogenetic diet shift can provide a competitive advantage if the supply of the adult resource is lower than the supply of the juvenile resource but that it always causes a disadvantage if the supply of the adult resource exceeds that of the juvenile resource.},

abstract = {The present chapter is complementary to the one by Warren Ewens. It contains almost no equations or genetics (or rather, both are implicitly there, but stay well hidden), fitnesses are not assumed to be constant, but keep changing (in genetical terms, selection is always seen as frequency dependent), the evolutionary path is considered as being shaped by the repeated substitution of novel mutations (as opposed to gene frequency change), and adaptive landscapes depict the fitness of potential mutant types over a space spanned by traits (instead of the mean fitness of a population over a space of gene frequencies). The reason for this difference in emphasis is that my first training is not as a mathematician or geneticist but as a naturalist, i.e., field oriented taxonomist-ecologist, which shapes the questions that have my interest. As a consequence, within evolutionary biology I am interested primarily in meso-evolution, defined here as evolutionary changes in the values of traits of representative individuals and concomitant patterns of taxonomic diversification. This in contrast to micro-evolution, a term reserved for the changes in gene frequencies on a population dynamical time scale (the topic of Warren Ewens' chapter), and macro-evolution, a term that then can be reserved for large scale changes like anatomical innovations, where one cannot even speak in terms of a fixed set of traits. Thus meso-evolution acts on a time scale above the micro-evolutionary scale of gene substitutions but below the scale on which the intricacies of the developmental process start to have a large influence.},

abstract = {Most heritable surnames, like Y chromosomes, are passed from father to son. These unique cultural markers of coancestry might therefore have a genetic correlate in shared Y chromosome types among men sharing surnames, although the link could be affected by mutation, multiple foundation for names, nonpaternity, and genetic drift. Here, we demonstrate through an analysis of 1,678 Y-chromosomal haplotypes within 40 British surnames a remarkably high degree of coancestry that generally increases as surnames become rarer. On average, the proportion of haplotypes lying within descent clusters is 62{\%} but ranges from 0{\%} to 87{\%}. The shallow time depth of many descent clusters within names, the lack of a detectable effect of surname derivation on diversity, and simulations of surname descent suggest that genetic drift through variation in reproductive success is important in structuring haplotype diversity. Modern patterns therefore provide little reliable information about the original founders of surnames some 700 years ago. A comparative analysis of published data on Y diversity within Irish surnames demonstrates a relative lack of surname frequency dependence of coancestry, a difference probably mediated through distinct Irish and British demographic histories including even more marked genetic drift in Ireland.},

abstract = {Although no historical information exists about the Indus civilization (flourished ca. 2600-1900 B.C.), archaeologists have uncovered about 3,800 short samples of a script that was used throughout the civilization. The script remains undeciphered, despite a large number of attempts and claimed decipherments over the past 80 years. Here, we propose the use of probabilistic models to analyze the structure of the Indus script. The goal is to reveal, through probabilistic analysis, syntactic patterns that could point the way to eventual decipherment. We illustrate the approach using a simple Markov chain model to capture sequential dependencies between signs in the Indus script. The trained model allows new sample texts to be generated, revealing recurring patterns of signs that could potentially form functional subunits of a possible underlying language. The model also provides a quantitative way of testing whether a particular string belongs to the putative language as captured by the Markov model. Application of this test to Indus seals found in Mesopotamia and other sites in West Asia reveals that the script may have been used to express different content in these regions. Finally, we show how missing, ambiguous, or unreadable signs on damaged objects can be filled in with most likely predictions from the model. Taken together, our results indicate that the Indus script exhibits rich synactic structure and the ability to represent diverse content. both of which are suggestive of a linguistic writing system rather than a nonlinguistic symbol system.},

abstract = {Two types of demographic analyses, perturbation analysis and uncertainty analysis, can be conducted to gain insights about matrix population models and guide population management. Perturbation analysis studies how the perturbation of demographic parameters (survival, growth, and reproduction parameters) may affect the population projection, while uncertainty analysis evaluates how much uncertainty there is in population dynamic predictions and where the uncertainty comes from. Previously, both perturbation analysis and uncertainty analysis were conducted on the long-term population growth rate. However, the population may not reach its equilibrium state, especially when there is management by harvesting or hunting. Recently, there has been an increased interest in short-term transient dynamics, which can differ from asymptotic long-term dynamics. There are currently techniques to conduct perturbation analyses of short-term transient dynamics, but no techniques have been proposed for uncertainty analysis of such dynamics. In this study, we introduced an uncertainty analysis technique, the general Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST), to study uncertainties in transient population dynamics. The general FAST is able to identify the amount of uncertainty in transient dynamics and contributions by different demographic parameters. We applied the general FAST to a mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) matrix population model to give a clear illustration of how uncertainty analysis can be conducted for transient dynamics arising from matrix population models. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {For most consumer species, winter represents a period of harsh food conditions in addition to the physiological strain that results from the low ambient temperatures. In size-structured populations, larger-bodied individuals do better during winter as they have larger energy reserves to buffer starvation periods. In contrast, smaller-bodied individuals do better under growing conditions, as they have lower maintenance costs. We study how the interplay between size-dependent life-history processes and seasonal changes in temperature and food availability shape the long-term dynamics of a size-structured consumer population and its unstructured resource. We show that the size dependence of maintenance requirements translates into a minimum body size that is needed for surviving starvation when consumers can adapt only to a limited extent to the low food densities in winter. This size threshold can lead to population extinction because adult individuals suffer only a little during winter and hence produce large numbers of offspring. Due to population feedback on the resource and intense intra-cohort competition, newborn consumers then fail to reach the size threshold for survival. Under these conditions, small numbers of individuals can survive, increase in density, and build up a population, which will subsequently go extinct due to its feedback on the resource. High juvenile mortality may prevent this ecological suicide from occurring, as it releases resource competition among newborns and speeds up their growth. In size-structured populations, annual fluctuations in temperature and food availability may thus lead to a conflict between individual fitness and population persistence.},

abstract = {In the current context of global infectious disease risks, a better understanding of the dynamics of major epidemics is urgently needed. Time-series analysis has appeared as an interesting approach to explore the dynamics of numerous diseases. Classical time-series methods can only be used for stationary time-series (in which the statistical properties do not vary with time). However, epidemiological time-series are typically noisy, complex and strongly non-stationary. Given this specific nature, wavelet analysis appears particularly attractive because it is well suited to the analysis of non-stationary signals. Here, we review the basic properties of the wavelet approach as an appropriate and elegant method for time-series analysis in epidemiological studies. The wavelet decomposition offers several advantages that are discussed in this paper based on epidemiological examples. In particular, the wavelet approach permits analysis of transient relationships between two signals and is especially suitable for gradual change in force by exogenous variables.},

The constraints come from the universal architecture of the human mind, which influences language form through the way it hears, articulates, remembers, and learns. However, within these constraints, there is latitude for variation from language to language. For example, the major categories of subject, verb, and object vary in their typical order, and some languages signal grammatical distinctions primary by syntax, or the combinatorics of words, whereas others achieve this mainly through morphology, or the internal mutation of words. What determines the historical evolution of any particular language across the possibility space formed by these different options?

This concept is fundamental to the study of epidemiology and within-host pathogen dynamics. Most importantly, R0 often serves as a threshold parameter that predicts whether an infection will spread. Related parameters which share this threshold behaviour, however, may or may not give the true value of R0. In this paper we give a brief overview of common methods of formulating R0 and surrogate threshold parameters from deterministic, non-structured models. We also review common means of estimating R0 from epidemiological data. Finally, we survey the recent use of R0 in assessing emerging diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, a number of recent livestock diseases, and vector-borne diseases malaria, dengue and West Nile virus.},

abstract = {Understanding population dynamics requires models that admit the complexity of natural populations and the data ecologists obtain from them. Populations possess structure, which may be defined as "fixed" stages through which individuals pass, with superimposed variability among individuals and groups. Data contain missing values and inaccurate censuses. From limited data ecologists attempt to predict life history schedules and population growth. We extend the "missing value" framework for Bayesian analysis of structured populations to admit the heterogeneity in demography and the limitations of data that are typical of ecological populations. Our hierarchical treatment of capture-recapture data allows inference on demographic rates contained in matrix transition models for populations that may be stratified by location and by other variables. Simulations with artificial data sets demonstrate the ability of the Bayesian model to Successfully estimate underlying parameters, even with incomplete census data. In contrast, traditional nonhierarchical models may lead to biased parameter estimates because of variation in recapture rates of individuals. Analyses of published demographic data on Common Terns and Taitu Hills rats illustrate the utility of the model. Predictive distributions of maturation age, survivorship, and population growth demonstrate profound impacts of population and data complexity.},

abstract = {Summary John Donne's famous line "`No man is an island, entire of itself"' has deep resonances for the dynamics of parasites. This is particularly true for microparasitic infections, such as viruses and bacteria, for which each susceptible host is a potential patch of favourable habitat. Propagules from infected "`patches"' can colonize others, followed by parasitic multiplication and "`local"' growth of the parasite population. Thus, at the scale of the host population, infectious dynamics bears strong analogies to metapopulation dynamics. Furthermore, host individuals are, more often than not, structured into local populations, within which contact among hosts may be very frequent and between which contacts may be less frequent. In this way, the spatiotemporal dynamics and persistence of parasites are determined at two scales: the infrapopulation scale (a local population scale; parasites within hosts) and the metapopulation scale (spatial and/or social aggregation of hosts). The spatiotemporal dynamics of infection in human and domestic systems are of particular academic interest because of the wealth of data combined with well-described natural histories.},

abstract = {An evolutionary capacitor buffers genotypic variation under normal conditions, thereby promoting the accumulation of hidden polymorphism. But it occasionally fails, thereby revealing this variation phenotypically. The principal example of an evolutionary capacitor is Hsp90, a molecular chaperone that targets an important set of signal transduction proteins. Experiments in Drosophila and Arabidopsis have demonstrated three key properties of Hsp90: (1) it suppresses phenotypic variation under normal conditions and releases this variation when functionally compromised; (2) its function is overwhelmed by environmental stress; and (3) it exerts pleiotropic effects on key developmental processes. But whether these properties necessarily make Hsp90 a significant and unique facilitator of adaptation is unclear. Here we use numerical simulations of complex gene networks, as well as genome-scale expression data from yeast single-gene deletion strains, to present a mechanism that extends the scope of evolutionary capacitance beyond the action of Hsp90 alone. We illustrate that most, and perhaps all, genes reveal phenotypic variation when functionally compromised, and that the availability of loss-of-function mutations accelerates adaptation to a new optimum phenotype. However, this effect does not require the mutations to be conditional on the environment. Thus, there might exist a large class of evolutionary capacitors whose effects on phenotypic variation complement the systemic, environment-induced effects of Hsp90.},

abstract = {The emergence of a complex language is one of the fundamental events of human evolution, and several remarkable features suggest the presence of fundamental principles of organization. These principles seem to be common to all languages. The best known is the so-called Zipf's law, which states that the frequency of a word decays as a (universal) power law of its rank. The possible origins of this law have been controversial, and its meaningfulness is still an open question. In this article, the early hypothesis of Zipf of a principle of least effort for explaining the law is shown to be sound. Simultaneous minimization in the effort of both hearer and speaker is formalized with a simple optimization process operating on a binary matrix of signal-object associations. Zipf's law is found in the transition between referentially useless systems and indexical reference systems. Our finding strongly suggests that Zipf's law is a hallmark of symbolic reference and not a meaningless feature. The implications for the evolution of language are discussed. We explain how language evolution can take advantage of a communicative phase transition.},

abstract = {Language is our legacy. It is the main evolutionary contribution of humans, and perhaps the most interesting trait that has emerged in the past 500 million years. Understanding how darwinian evolution gives rise to human language requires the integration of formal language theory, learning theory and evolutionary dynamics. Formal language theory provides a mathematical description of language and grammar. Learning theory formalizes the task of language acquisition it can be shown that no procedure can learn an unrestricted set of languages. Universal grammar specifies the restricted set of languages learnable by the human brain. Evolutionary dynamics can be formulated to describe the cultural evolution of language and the biological evolution of universal grammar.},

abstract = {Most species live in species-rich food webs; yet, for a century, most mathematical models for population dynamics have included only one or two species. We ask whether such models are relevant to the real world. Two-species population models of an interacting consumer and resource collapse to one-species dynamics when recruitment to the resource population is unrelated to resource abundance, thereby weakening the coupling between consumer and resource. We predict that, in nature, generalist consumers that feed on many species should similarly show one-species dynamics. We test this prediction using cyclic populations, in which it is easier to infer underlying mechanisms, and which are widespread in nature. Here we show that one-species cycles can be distinguished from consumer resource cycles by their periods. We then analyse a large number of time series from cyclic populations in nature and show that almost all cycling, generalist consumers examined have periods that are consistent with one-species dynamics. Thus generalist consumers indeed behave as if they were one-species populations, and a one-species model is a valid representation for generalist population dynamics in many-species food webs.},

It determines the range of grammatical hypothesis that children entertain during language learning and the procedure they use for evaluating input sentences. How universal grammar arose is a major challenge for evolutionary biology. We present a mathematical framework for the evolutionary dynamics of grammar learning. The central result is a coherence threshold, which specifies the condition for a universal grammar to induce coherent communication within a population. We study selection of grammars within the same universal grammar and competition between different universal grammars. We calculate the condition under which natural selection favors the emergence of rule-based, generative grammars that underlie complex language.},

abstract = {Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are widespread and abundant in both plant and animal genomes. Despite the discovery and characterization of many MITE families, their origin and transposition mechanism are still poorly understood, largely because MITEs are nonautonomous elements with no coding capacity. The starting point for this study was P instability factor (PIF), an active DNA transposable element family from maize that was first identified following multiple mutagenic insertions into exactly the same site in intron 2 of the maize anthocyanin regulatory gene R. In this study we report the isolation of a maize Tourist-like MITE family called miniature PIF (mPIF) that shares several features with PIF elements, including identical terminal inverted repeats, similar subterminal sequences, and an unusual but striking preference for an extended 9-bp target site. These shared features indicate that mPIF and PIF elements were amplified by the same or a closely related transposase. This transposase was identified through the isolation of several PIF elements and the identification of one element (called PIFa) that cosegregated with PIF activity. PIFa encodes a putative protein with homologs in Arabidopsis, rice, sorghum, nematodes, and a fungus. Our data suggest that PIFa and these PIF-like elements belong to a new eukaryotic DNA transposon superfamily that is distantly related to the bacterial IS5 group and are responsible for the origin and spread of Tourist-like MITEs.},

abstract = {Bubonic plague (Yersinia pestis) is generally thought of as a historical disease; however, it is still responsible for around 1000-3000 deaths each year worldwide. This paper expands the analysis of a model for bubonic plague that encompasses the disease dynamics in rat, flea and human populations. Some key variables of the deterministic model, including the force of infection to humans, are shown to be robust to changes in the basic parameters, although variation in the flea searching efficiency, and the movement rates of rats and fleas will be considered throughout the paper. The stochastic behaviour of the corresponding metapopulation model is discussed, with attention focused on the dynamics of rats and the force of infection at the local spatial scale. Short-lived local epidemics in rats govern the invasion of the disease and produce an irregular pattern of human cases similar to those observed. However, the endemic behaviour in a few rat subpopulations allows the disease to persist for many years. This spatial stochastic model is also used to identify the criteria for the spread to human populations in terms of the rat density. Finally, the full stochastic model is reduced to the form of a probabilistic cellular automaton, which allows the analysis of a large number of replicated epidemics in large populations. This simplified model enables us to analyse the spatial properties of rat epidemics and the effects of movement rates, and also to test whether the emergent metapopulation behaviour is a property of the local dynamics rather than the precise details of the model.},

abstract = {Cannibals and their victims often share common resources and thus potentially compete. Smaller individuals are often competitively superior to larger ones because of size-dependent scaling of foraging and metabolic rates, while larger ones may use cannibalism to counter this competition. We study the interplay between cannibalism and competition using a size-structured population model in which all individuals consume a shared resource but in which larger ones may cannibalize smaller conspecifics. In this model, intercohort competition causes single-cohort cycles when cannibalism is absent. Moderate levels of cannibalism reduce intercohort competition, enabling coexistence of many cohorts. More voracious cannibalism, in combination with competition, produces large-amplitude cycles and a bimodal population size distribution with many small and few giant individuals. These coexisting "dwarfs" and "giants" have very different life histories, resulting from a reversal in importance of cannibalism and competition. The population structure at time of birth determines whether individuals suffer severe cannibalism, with the few survivors reaching giant sizes, or whether they suffer intense intracohort competition, with all individuals remaining small. These model results agree remarkably well with empirical data on perch population dynamics. We argue that the induction of cannibalistic giants in piscivorous fish is a population-dynamic emergent phenomenon that requires a combination of size-dependent cannibalism and competition.},

@article{Austerlitz2000,
abstract = {Tree species are striking for their high within-population diversity and low among-population differentiation for nuclear genes. In contrast, annual plants show much more differentiation for nuclear genes but much less diversity than trees. The usual explanation for this difference is that pollen flow, and therefore gene flow, is much higher for trees. This explanation is problematic because it relies on equilibrium hypotheses. Because trees have very recently recolonized temperate areas, they have experienced many foundation events, which usually reduce within-population diversity and increase differentiation. Only extremely high levels of gene flow could counterbalance these successive founder effects. We develop a model to study the impact of life cycle of forest trees, in particular of the length of their juvenile phase, on genetic diversity and differentiation during the glacial period and the following colonization period. We show that both a reasonably high level of pollen flow and the life-cycle characteristics of trees are needed to explain the observed structure of genetic diversity. We also show that gene flow and life cycle both have an impact on maternally inherited cytoplasmic genes, which are characterized both in trees and annual species by much less diversity and much more differentiation than nuclear genes.},

abstract = {Little is known about the design principles of transcriptional regulation networks that control gene expression in cells. Recent advances in data collection and analysis, however, are generating unprecedented amounts of information about gene regulation networks. To understand these complex wiring diagrams, we sought to break down such networks into basic building blocks. We generalize the notion of motifs, widely used for sequence analysis, to the level of networks. We define 'network motifs' as patterns of interconnections that recur in many different parts of a network at frequencies much higher than those found in randomized networks. We applied new algorithms for systematically detecting network motifs to one of the best-characterized regulation networks, that of direct transcriptional interactions in Escherichia coli. We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances of three highly significant motifs. Each network motif has a specific function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external signals. The motif structure also allows an easily interpretable view of the entire known transcriptional network of the organism. This approach may help define the basic computational elements of other biological networks.},

abstract = {Summary HIV transmission models have become very complex. The behavior of some of these models may only be explored by uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, because the structural complexity of the model are coupled with a high degree of uncertainty in estimating the values of the input parameters. Uncertainty analysis may be used to assess the variability (prediction imprecision) in the outcome variable that is due to the uncertainty in estimating the input values. A sensitivity analysis can extend an uncertainty analysis by identifying which parameters are important in contributing to the prediction imprecision (i.e., how do changes in the values of the input parameters alter the value of the outcome variable). In this paper an uncertainty and a sensitivity analysis are described and applied; both analyses are based upon the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) scheme, which is an extremely efficient sampling design proposed by McKay, Conover {\&} Beckman (1979). The methods described in this paper have not previously been applied to deterministic models of disease transmission, although these models have many characteristics in common with the risk assessment models that the strategies were designed to investigate. The utility of the LHS uncertainty and the LHS/PRC (Latin Hypercube Sampling/Partial Rank Correlation) sensitivity analysis techniques are illustrated by analyzing a complex deterministic model of HIV transmission.},

Ty1 mutants with defects in IN, the conserved termini of Ty1 cDNA, or priming plus-strand DNA synthesis, however, were still able to efficiently insert into the genome when the elements were expressed from the GAL1 promoter present on a multicopy plasmid. As with normal transposition, formation of the exceptional insertions required an RNA intermediate, Ty1 reverse transcriptase, and Ty1 protease. In contrast to Ty1 transposition, at least 70{\%} of the chromosomal insertions consisted of complex multimeric Ty1 elements. Ty1 cDNA was transferred to the inducing plasmid as well as to the genome, and transfer required the recombination and repair gene RAD52. Furthermore, multimeric insertions occurred without altering the levels of total Ty1 RNA, virus-like particle-associated RNA or cDNA, Ty1 capsid proteins, or IN. These results suggest that Ty1 cDNA is utilized much more efficiently for homologous recombination when IN-mediated integration is blocked.},

We established an experimental population of inbred and outbred Silene latifolia plants to evaluate the effects of (i) inbreeding depression, (ii) phenotypic variation and (iii) relatedness between mates on male fitness under natural pollination. Paternity analysis revealed that outbred males sired significantly more offspring than inbred males. Independently of the effects of inbreeding, male fitness depended on several male traits, including a sexually dimorphic (flower number) and a gametophytic trait (in vitro pollen germination rate). In addition, full-sib matings were less frequent than randomly expected. Thus, inbreeding, phenotype and genetic dissimilarity simultaneously affect male fitness in this animal-pollinated plant. While inbreeding depression might threaten population persistence, the deficiency of effective matings between sibs and the higher fitness of outbred males will reduce its occurrence and counter genetic erosion.},

abstract = {Deaths from cholera in London, UK, were recorded weekly from 1824 to 1901. Three features of the time series stand out: (i) cholera deaths were strongly seasonal, with peak mortality almost always in the summer, (ii) the only non-summer outbreaks occurred in the spring of 1832, the autumn of 1848 and the winter of 1853, and (iii) extraordinarily severe summer outbreaks occurred in 1832, 1849, 1854 and 1866 (the four 'great' cholera years). The non-summer outbreaks of 1832, 1848 and 1853 appear to have been herald waves of newly invading cholera strains. In addition, a simple mathematical model confirms that a non-summer introduction of a new cholera strain can result in an initial herald wave, followed by a severe outbreak the following summer. Through the analysis of the genomes of nineteenth-century specimens, it may be possible to identify the strains that caused these herald waves and the well-known cholera epidemics that followed.},

abstract = {Complex phenotypes are often controlled by many interacting genes. One question emerging from such organization is how selection, acting at the phenotypic level, shapes the evolution of genes involved in regulatory networks controlling the phenotypes. We studied this issue through a matrix model of such networks. In a population submitted to selection, we simulated the evolution of a quantitative trait controlled by a set of loci that regulate each other through positive or negative interactions. Investigating several levels of selection intensity on the trait, we studied the evolution of regulation intensity between the genes and the evolution of the genetic diversity of those genes as an indirect measure of the strength of selection acting on them. We show that an increasing intensity of selection on the phenotype leads to an increased level of regulation between the loci. Moreover, we found that the genes responding more strongly to selection within the network were those evolving towards stronger regulatory action on the other genes and/or those that are the less regulated by the other genes. This observation is strongest for an intermediate level of selection. This may explain why several experimental studies have shown evidence of selection on regulatory genes inside gene networks.},

abstract = {Surveys of gene expression reveal extensive variability both within and between a wide range of species. Compelling cases have been made for adaptive changes in gene regulation, but the proportion of expression divergence attributable to natural selection remains unclear. Distinguishing adaptive changes driven by positive selection from neutral divergence resulting from mutation and genetic drift is critical for understanding the evolution of gene expression. Here, we review the various methods that have been used to test for signs of selection in genomic expression data. We also discuss properties of regulatory systems relevant to neutral models of gene expression. Despite some potential caveats, published studies provide considerable evidence for adaptive changes in gene expression. Future challenges for studies of regulatory evolution will be to quantify the frequency of adaptive changes, identify the genetic basis of expression divergence and associate changes in gene expression with specific organismal phenotypes.},

abstract = {Identification of lineage-specific innovations in genomic control elements is critical for understanding transcriptional regulatory networks and phenotypic heterogeneity. We analyzed, from an evolutionary perspective, the binding regions of seven mammalian transcription factors (ESR1, TP53, MYC, RELA, POU5F1, SOX2, and CTCF) identified on a genome-wide scale by different chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches and found that only a minority of sites appear to be conserved at the sequence level. Instead, we uncovered a pervasive association with genomic repeats by showing that a large fraction of the bona fide binding sites for five of the seven transcription factors (ESR1, TP53, POU5F1, SOX2, and CTCF) are embedded in distinctive families of transposable elements. Using the age of the repeats, we established that these repeat-associated binding sites (RABS) have been associated with significant regulatory expansions throughout the mammalian phylogeny. We validated the functional significance of these RABS by showing that they are over-represented in proximity of regulated genes and that the binding motifs within these repeats have undergone evolutionary selection. Our results demonstrate that transcriptional regulatory networks are highly dynamic in eukaryotic genomes and that transposable elements play an important role in expanding the repertoire of binding sites.},

abstract = {The acts of learning and memory are thought to emerge from the modifications of synaptic connections between neurons, as guided by sensory feedback during behavior. However, much is unknown about how such synaptic processes can sculpt and are sculpted by neuronal population dynamics and an interaction with the environment. Here, we embodied a simulated network, inspired by dissociated cortical neuronal cultures, with an artificial animal (an animat) through a sensory-motor loop consisting of structured stimuli, detailed activity metrics incorporating spatial information, and an adaptive training algorithm that takes advantage of spike timing dependent plasticity. By using our design, we demonstrated that the network was capable of learning associations between multiple sensory inputs and motor outputs, and the animat was able to adapt to a new sensory mapping to restore its goal behavior: move toward and stay within a user-defined area. We further showed that successful learning required proper selections of stimuli to encode sensory inputs and a variety of training stimuli with adaptive selection contingent on the animat's behavior. We also found that an individual network had the flexibility to achieve different multi-task goals, and the same goal behavior could be exhibited with different sets of network synaptic strengths. While lacking the characteristic layered structure of in vivo cortical tissue, the biologically inspired simulated networks could tune their activity in behaviorally relevant manners, demonstrating that leaky integrate-and-fire neural networks have an innate ability to process information. This closed-loop hybrid system is a useful tool to study the network properties intermediating synaptic plasticity and behavioral adaptation. The training algorithm provides a stepping stone towards designing future control systems, whether with artificial neural networks or biological animats themselves.},

Their evolution depends on the interaction they have with the other components of the genome, including genes and other transposable elements. These relationships are complex and have often been compared to those of species living and competing in an ecosystem. The aim of this current work is a proposition to fill the conceptual gap existing between genome biology and ecology, assuming that genomic components, such as transposable elements families, can be compared to species interacting in an ecosystem. Using this framework, some of the main models defined in the population genetics of transposable elements can then been reformulated, and some new kinds of realistic relationships, such as symbiosis between different genomic components, can then be modelled and explored. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The speech code is a vehicle of language: it defines a set of forms used by a community to carry information. Such a code is necessary to support the linguistic interactions that allow humans to communicate. How then may a speech code be formed prior to the existence of linguistic interactions? Moreover, the human speech code is discrete and compositional, shared by all the individuals of a community but different across communities, and phoneme inventories are characterized by statistical regularities. How can a speech code with these properties form? We try to approach these questions in the paper, using the "methodology of the artificial". We build a society of artificial agents, and detail a mechanism that shows the formation of a discrete speech code without pre-supposing the existence of linguistic capacities or of coordinated interactions. The mechanism is based on a low-level model of sensory-motor interactions. We show that the integration of certain very simple and non-language-specific neural devices leads to the formation of a speech code that has properties similar to the human speech code. This result relies on the self-organizing properties of a generic coupling between perception and production within agents, and on the interactions between agents. The artificial system helps us to develop better intuitions on how speech might have appeared, by showing how self-organization might have helped natural selection to find speech.},

There are few gaps in the first part of the records (A.D. 622{\&}{\#}8211;1470) and larger gaps later (A.D. 1471{\&}{\#}8211;1922). We apply advanced spectral methods, Singular-Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and the Multi-Taper Method (MTM), to fill the gaps and to locate interannual and interdecadal periodicities. The gap filling uses a novel, iterative version of SSA. Our analysis reveals several statistically significant features of the records: a nonlinear, data-adaptive trend that includes a 256-year cycle, a quasi-quadriennial (4.2-year) and a quasi-biennial (2.2-year) mode, as well as additional periodicities of 64, 19, 12, and, most strikingly, 7 years. The quasi-quadriennial and quasi-biennial modes support the long-established connection between the Nile River discharge and the El-Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. The longest periods might be of astronomical origin. The 7-year periodicity, possibly related to the biblical cycle of lean and fat years, seems to be due to North Atlantic influences.},

abstract = {Heterochromatin has been defined as deeply staining chromosomal material that remains condensed in interphase, whereas euchromatin undergoes de-condensation. Heterochromatin is found near centromeres and telomeres, but interstitial sites of heterochromatin (knobs) are common in plant genomes and were first described in maize. These regions are repetitive and late-replicating. In Drosophila, heterochromatin influences gene expression, a heterochromatin phenomenon called position effect variegation. Similarities between position effect variegation in Drosophila and gene silencing in maize mediated by "controlling elements" (that is, transposable elements) led in part to the proposal that heterochromatin is composed of transposable elements, and that such elements scattered throughout the genome might regulate development. Using microarray analysis, we show that heterochromatin in Arabidopsis is determined by transposable elements and related tandem repeats, under the control of the chromatin remodelling ATPase DDM1 (Decrease in DNA Methylation 1). Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) correspond to these sequences, suggesting a role in guiding DDM1. We also show that transposable elements can regulate genes epigenetically, but only when inserted within or very close to them. This probably accounts for the regulation by DDM1 and the DNA methyltransferase MET1 of the euchromatic, imprinted gene FWA, as its promoter is provided by transposable-element-derived tandem repeats that are associated with siRNAs.},

abstract = {Complete genomic sequences from diverse phylogenetic lineages reveal notable increases in genome complexity from prokaryotes to multicellular eukaryotes. The changes include gradual increases in gene number, resulting from the retention of duplicate genes, and more abrupt increases in the abundance of spliceosomal introns and mobile genetic elements. We argue that many of these modifications emerged passively in response to the long-term population-size reductions that accompanied increases in organism size. According to this model, much of the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes was initiated by nonadaptive processes, and this in turn provided novel substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic complexity by natural selection. The enormous long-term effective population sizes of prokaryotes may impose a substantial barrier to the evolution of complex genomes and morphologies.},

abstract = {1. We propose the method of 'phase analysis' for studying the spatio-temporal fluctuations of animal populations, and use this method for helping identify remarkable synchronized population fluctuations that may sometimes be found over very large spatial domains. 2. The method requires decomposing the observed time series of population fluctuations into two components - one that quantifies the changing phase of the signal, and the other that quantifies the changing amplitude. 3. Two populations are considered to be 'phase synchronized' if there is locking or synchrony between their phase components, while their associated amplitudes may nevertheless remain largely uncorrelated. 4. Since environmental noise often masks population synchrony, a null hypothesis approach is used to detect whether the phase variables are locked more than would be expected by chance alone. 5. The technique is thus particularly appropriate for ecological analyses where it is often important to study evidence of weak interactions in irregular non-stationary and noisy time series. Because climatic patterns (and predicted climate changes) almost certainly influence population dynamics, the approach appears particularly relevant for analysing the potential links between climatic fluctuations and population abundance.},

@article{McCollum2002,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The potential adaptive significance of transposable elements (TEs) to the host genomes in which they reside is a topic that has been hotly debated by molecular evolutionists for more than two decades. Recent genomic analyses have demonstrated that TE fragments are associated with functional genes in plants and animals. These findings suggest that TEs may contribute significantly to gene evolution. RESULTS: We have analyzed two transposable elements associated with genes in the sequenced Drosophila melanogaster y; cn bw sp strain. A fragment of the Antonia long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon is present in the intron of Chitinase 3 (Cht3), a gene located within the constitutive heterochromatin of chromosome 2L. Within the euchromatin of chromosome 2R a full-length Burdock LTR retrotransposon is located immediately 3' to cathD, a gene encoding cathepsin D. We tested for the presence of these two TE/gene associations in strains representing 12 geographically diverse populations of D. melanogaster. While the cathD insertion variant was detected only in the sequenced y; cn bw sp strain, the insertion variant present in the heterochromatic Cht3 gene was found to be fixed throughout twelve D. melanogaster populations and in a D. mauritiana strain suggesting that it maybe of adaptive significance. To further test this hypothesis, we sequenced a 685bp region spanning the LTR fragment in the intron of Cht3 in strains representative of the two sibling species D. melanogaster and D. mauritiana (approximately 2.7 million years divergent). The level of sequence divergence between the two species within this region was significantly lower than expected from the neutral substitution rate and lower than the divergence observed between a randomly selected intron of the Drosophila Alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a 359 bp fragment of an Antonia retrotransposon (complete LTR is 659 bp) located within the intron of the Drosophila melanogaster Cht3 gene is of adaptive evolutionary significance. Our results are consistent with previous suggestions that the presence of TEs in constitutive heterochromatin may be of significance to the expression of heterochromatic genes.},

@article{Feschotte2002a,
abstract = {A 128 bp insertion in a mutant maize waxy gene (the wxB2 allele) led to the identification of a group of related elements called Tourist in the untranslated regions of genes from diverse grass species. A 257-bp insertion in a sorghum Tourist element led to the discovery of a second family of elements called Stowaway, in the genes of a diversity of flowering plants. Tourist and Stowaway elements share structural but not sequence similarity. Both are short ({\~{}}100 to 500 bp), have conserved terminal repeats, have target site preference (Tourist, TAA; Stowaway, TA) and, of most significance for this chapter, have no coding potential. All of these features are reminiscent of the nonautonomous members of some DNA transposon families. However, it was the high copy number of Tourist and Stowaway elements and the uniformity of related elements that served to set them apart from previously described nonautonomous elements . For this reason, and because they were being mistakenly classified as SINEs, it was decided to name these and other structurally related elements miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements, or MITEs. Although first discovered in plants, MITEs were soon found in several animal genomes including C. elegans, mosquitoes, fish, Xenopus and humans. With the advent of genome sequencing projects, vast amounts of DNA sequence, from a wide variety of plant and animal species, has become available for analysis. MITES, with their high copy number, distinct structural features (target site duplications, TSDs and terminal inverted repeats, TIRs) and compact stature, are relatively easy to mine from DNA sequence databases. As such, the number of MITEs and MITE families has proliferated in the literature much as the MITEs themselves have proliferated in the genome. Initially this led to a confusing jumble of names and hypothesized relationships. This confusion reflected two important facts about MITEs. First, as very short, nonautonomous elements, none of the available MITE sequences revealed clear-cut relationships with known transposases. Second, and perhaps most significantly, no MITE family to date has been shown to be actively transposing. In the absence of coding sequences and activity, it has been difficult to determine how MITEs originate and how they attain their high copy numbers. Fortunately, this situation has changed dramatically in the past few years as two approaches have been successfully employed to establish relationships between MITEs and existing DNA transposon families. We call these approaches "bottom up" and "top down" and they are illustrated below in the descriptions of Tc1/mariner- like MITEs and PIF/Harbinger-like MITEs, respectively. With a bottom up approach, the sequences of nonautonomous family members are used as queries to identify potentially autonomous family members through similarities in their TSDs and TIRs. This approach has revealed complex relationships between hundreds of MITE families and the well-characterized Tc1/mariner superfamily of transposases. In contrast, the top down approach began with the discovery that a genetically active DNA transposon system in maize (called PIF) had MITE members (called mPIF) and led to the identification of a new superfamily of transposases that are responsible for the transposition of Tourist-like MITEs.},

Thus, ??? 0 is a threshold parameter for the model. An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super- and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for ??? 0 near one. This criterion, together with the definition of ??? 0, is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector-host models and can be applied to more complex models.

abstract = {A central problem in ecology is explaining the causes of population fluctuations, and an important step in the solution is determining the structure of the negative feedback (density dependent) process regulating population dynamics. The conven- tional way to determine the dimension or order of density dependence in a time series is to calculate the partial autorcorrelation function (PACF). We maintain, however, that PACF is not designed with biological populations in mind and has the wrong null model for detecting the structure of density dependence. We suggest an alterna- tive diagnostic, the partial rate correlation function (PRCF), which is specifically designed for biological populations and has an appropriate null model for detecting their density dependent structures. Tests with simulated data show PRCF to be superior to PACF in detecting the underlying density dependent structure of two simple mathematical models},

It is believed that many species originated through allopatric diver- gence, where new species arise from geographically isolated populations of the same ancestral species1–3 . In contrast, the possibility of sympatric speciation (in which new species arise without geographical isolation) has often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical difficulties2,3 ing sympatric speciation concentrated on particular aspects of the problem while neglecting others4–10 .Most previous models analys- .Here we present a model that integrates a novel combination of different features and show that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of competition for resources. We use multilocus genetics to describe sexual repro- duction in an individual-based model, and we consider the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals mate prefer- entially with like individuals) depending either on an ecological character affecting resource use or on a selectively neutral marker trait. In both cases, evolution of assortative mating often leads to reproductive isolation between ecologically diverging subpopula- tions.When assortative mating depends on a marker trait, and is therefore not directly linked to resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between the marker and the ecological trait. Our theory conforms well with mounting empirical evidence for the sympatric origin of many species},

These elements have been proposed to have a number of functions in the human genome, and have certainly had a major impact on genomic architecture. Alu elements continue to amplify at a rate of about one insertion every 200 new births. We have found 16 examples of diseases caused by the insertion of Alu elements, suggesting that they may contribute to about 0.1{\%} of human genetic disorders by this mechanism. The large number of Alu elements within primate genomes also provides abundant opportunities for unequal homologous recombination events. These events often occur intrachromosomally, resulting in deletion or duplication of exons in a gene, but they also can occur interchromosomally, causing more complex chromosomal abnormalities. We have found 33 cases of germ-line genetic diseases and 16 cases of cancer caused by unequal homologous recombination between Alu repeats. We estimate that this mode of mutagenesis accounts for another 0.3{\%} of human genetic diseases. Between these different mechanisms, Alu elements have not only contributed a great deal to the evolution of the genome but also continue to contribute to a significant portion of human genetic diseases.},

abstract = {The ontogenetic scaling of foraging capacity strongly influences the competitive ability of differently sized individuals within a species. We develop a physiologically structured model to investigate the effect of different ontogenetic size scalings of the attack rate on the population dynamics of a consumer-resource system. The resource is assumed to reproduce continuously whereas the consumer only reproduces at discrete time instants. Depending on the ontogenetic size scaling, the model exhibited recruit-driven cycles, stable fixed point dynamics, non-recruit juvenile-driven cycles, quasiperiodic orbits, or chaotic dynamics. The kind of dynamics observed was related to the maintenance resource levels required of differently sized individuals. Stable fixed point dynamics was, besides at the persistence boundary, only observed when the minimum resource levels were similar for newborns and mature individuals. The tendency for large population fluctuations over a wide range of the parameter space was due to the consumer's pulsed reproduction. Background mortality and length of season were major determinants of cycle length. Model dynamics strongly resembled empirically observed dynamics from fish and Daphnia populations with respect to both patterns and mechanisms. The non-recruit juvenile-driven dynamics is suggested to occur in populations with size-dependent interference or preemptive competition like cicada populations.},

abstract = {A number of prophylactic vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have passed through phase I clinical trials, and phase II clinical trials are now being planned. These vaccines are not expected to be perfect and might fail in a number of different ways. This paper shows how to equate different aspects of imperfection in a prophylactic vaccine in terms of impact upon levels of herd immunity, and hence upon the vaccine coverage required for eradication. Such comparisons reveal that an otherwise perfect vaccine that gives protection which wanes with a half-life of 10 years is only as good as a vaccine that works in 30{\%} of people giving them complete, lifelong protection. The paper goes on to compare predicted patterns of seroconversion that would be observed in clinical trials and in community-wide vaccination campaigns for vaccines that confer the same levels of herd immunity but are imperfect in different ways.},

abstract = {A method is presented for estimating age-specific mortality based on minimal information: a model life table and an estimate of longevity. This approach uses expected patterns of mammalian survivorship to define a general model of age-specific mortality rates. One such model life table is based on data for northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinu.r) using Siler's (1979) 5-parameter competing risk model. Alternative model life tables are based on historical data for human females and on a published model for Old World monkeys. Survival rates for a marine mammal species are then calculated by scaling these models by the longevity of that species. By using a realistic model (instead of assuming constant mortality), one can see more easily the real biological limits to population growth. The mortality estimation procedure is illustrated with examples of spotted dol-phins (Stenella attenuata) and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena).},

abstract = {Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are increasingly being implicated in diverse functional roles. Majority of these ncRNAs have their origin in the repetitive elements of genome. Significantly, increase in genomic complexity has been correlated with increase in repetitive content of the genome. Primate-specific Alu repeats, belonging to SINE class of repeats, is the most abundant repeat class inhabiting the human genome. Of the many possible functional roles of Alu repeats, they have been shown to modulate human transcriptome by virtue of harboring diverse array of functional RNA pol II TFBS, cryptic splice-site-mediated Alu exonization and as probable miRNA targets. Retro-transposition of Alu harboring TFBS has shaped up gene-specific regulatory networks. Alu exonized transcripts are raw material for dsRNA-mediated A-I editing leading to nuclear retention of transcripts and change in miRNA target. miRNA targets within Alu may titrate the effective miRNA or transcript concentration, thus acting as 'miRNA sponge'. Differential levels of Alu RNA during different conditions of stress also await clear functional understanding. These have contributed toward evolution of complex regulatory repertoire leading to the evolution of primate-specific functions. Recent reports of co-localization of pol II and pol III binding sites near the gene and elsewhere in the genome, increase the possibility of dynamic co-ordination between both pol II and pol III determining the ultimate transcriptional outcome. Dynamic and functional Alu repeats seem to be centrally placed to modulate the transcriptional landscape of human genome.},

abstract = {Bacterial cells evolved under prolonged stress often have a growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP); we expect GASP cells to maintain a proliferative state and dominate wild-type cells during starvation, especially when nutrients are limited and the medium has been conditioned. However, when we compete GASP mutants against wild-type cells in a chain of microfluidic microhabitat patches (MHPs) with alternating nutrient-rich and nutrient-limited regions, we observe the reverse effect: wild-type cells achieve maximum relative density under nutrient-limited conditions, while GASP cells dominate nutrient-rich regions. We explain this surprising observation in terms of ideal free distributions, where we show that wild-type cells maximize their fitness at high cell density by redistributing themselves to sparsely populated MHPs. At the microscopic level, we describe how biofilm formation also contributes to the population redistribution. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for social interactions of more complex organisms.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study is to document the evolution of the lactase persistence trait in Central Asia, a geographical area that is thought to have been a region of long-term pastoralism. Several ethnic groups co-exist in this area: Indo-Iranian speakers who are traditionally agriculturist (Tajik) and Turkic speakers who used to be nomadic herders (Kazakh, Karakalpak, Kyrgyz, Turkmen). It was recently demonstrated that horse milking practice existed in the Botai culture of Kazakhstan as early as 5,500 BP ( Outram et al. 2009 ). However, the frequency of the lactase persistence trait and its genetic basis in Central Asian populations remain largely unknown. We propose here the first genotype-phenotype study of lactase persistence in Central Asia based on 183 individuals, as well as the estimation of the time of expansion of the lactase-persistence associated polymorphism. Our results show a remarkable genetic-phenotypic correlation, with the causal polymorphism being the same than in Europe (-13.910C{\textgreater}T, rs4988235). The lactase persistence trait is at low frequency in these populations: between 25{\%} and 32{\%} in the Kazakh population (traditionally herders), according to phenotype used, and between 11{\%} and 30{\%} in the Tajiko-Uzbek population (agriculturalists). The difference in lactase persistence between populations, even if small, is significant when using individuals concordant for both excretion of breath hydrogen and the lactose tolerance blood glucose test phenotypes (P = 0.018, 25{\%} for Kazakh vs. 11{\%} for Tajiko-Uzbeks), and the difference in frequency of the -13.910*T allele is almost significant (P = 0.06, 30{\%} for Kazakhs vs. 19{\%} for Tajiko-Uzbeks). Using the surrounding haplotype, we estimate a date of expansion of the T allele around 6,000-12,000 yrs ago, which is consistent with archaeological records for the emergence of agropastoralism and pastoralism in Central Asia.},

We found that forces applied on the cell body direct spindle orientation during mitosis. We further show that external constraints induce a polarization of dynamic subcortical actin structures that correlate with spindle movements.

abstract = {We use six decades of catch-at-age data for perch (Perca fluviatilis) and pike (Esox lucius) in Windermere (UK) to estimate age- and sex-specific population sizes, natural mortalities and catchabilities in both species. Population sizes are estimated by fitting age structured population models to the catch-at-age data using standard maximum likelihood methods. We validate our methods using data simulations, and use our estimates of vital rates (natural mortality, recruitment and catahability) to address important aspects of fisheries biology. Our model indicates that strong fishery selection against male perch apparently triggered a population collapse, highlighting that sex-selective fisheries can be harmful even at a reasonable exploitation rate (here ≤30{\%}). Recruitment (R) increased with the abundance of spawners (S) in both species, but it also responded to both abiotic and other biotic factors. In particular, increased predator (pike) abundance induced a change from compensation to depensation in the prey (perch) SR relationship, thus favouring the occurrence of an Allee effect. Our study provides reference points for the effective exploitation of pike and perch populations, and underscores the need for ecosystem-based harvesting management. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

This work has provided much insight on the role that heterogeneity in host contact patterns plays on infectious disease dynamics. Despite the important understanding afforded by the probability and simulation paradigm, this approach does not directly address important questions about the structure of contact networks such as what is the best network model for a particular mode of disease transmission, how parameter values of a given model should be estimated, or how precisely the data allow us to estimate these parameter values. We argue that these questions are best answered within a statistical framework and discuss the role of statistical inference in estimating contact networks from epidemiological data.},

This article presents a flexible parametric model that can adequately capture the varying patterns of the age-specific fertility curves of African countries. The model has parameters that are interpretable in terms of demographic indices. The performance of this model was compared with other commonly used models and Akaike's Information Criterion was used for selecting the model with best fit. The presented model was able to reproduce the empirical fertility data of 11 out of 15 countries better than the other models considered.},

abstract = {Human language has long been viewed as a product of both genes and individual external experience or culture, but the key puzzle has always been to assess the relative contribution of each. Is language more like fashion hemlines or more like the number of fingers on each hand? On the one hand, we know that all normal people, unlike any cats or fish, uniformly grow up speaking some language, just like having 5 fingers on each hand, so language must be part of what is unique to the human genome. However, if one is born in Beijing one winds up speaking a very different language than if one is born in Mumbai, so the number-of-fingers analogy is not quite correct. The right answer must therefore cut a fine line between sufficient genomic constraint guaranteeing that every child will successfully develop an adult language and sufficient lability guaranteeing that no matter where they are born each child will acquire the language of its caretakers. Now a new study in a recent issue of PNAS (1) promises to shed light on this fine balance between cultural experience and genetic entrenchment to language's design, all within the context of biological evolution. It maintains that the linguistic particulars distinguishing Mandarin from Hindi cannot have arisen as genetically encoded and selected-for adaptations via at least one common route linking evolution and learning, the Baldwin–Simpson effect (2).},

Despite extensive research, the relative impact of these opposing forces and hence the directionality of genome size change remains unknown. In Gossypium (cotton), the 3-fold genome size variation among diploids is due largely to copy number variation of the gypsy-like retrotransposon Gorge3. Here we combine comparative sequence analysis with a modeling approach to study the directionality of genome size change in Gossypium. We demonstrate that the rate of DNA removal in the smaller genomes is sufficient to reverse genome expansion through Gorge3 proliferation. These data indicate that rates of DNA loss can be highly variable even within a single plant genus, and that the known mechanisms of DNA loss can indeed reverse the march toward genomic obesity.},

abstract = {G.C. Williams's 1957 hypothesis famously argues that higher age-independent, or "extrinsic," mortality should select for faster rates of senescence. Long-lived species should therefore show relatively few deaths from extrinsic causes such as predation and starvation. Theoretical explorations and empirical tests of Williams's hypothesis have flourished in the past decade but it has not yet been tested empirically among humans. We test Williams's hypothesis using mortality data from subsistence populations and from historical cohorts from Sweden and England/Wales, and examine whether rates of actuarial aging declined over the past two centuries. We employ three aging measures: mortality rate doubling time (MRDT), Ricklefs's omega, and the slope of mortality hazard from ages 60-70, m'(60-70), and model mortality using both Weibull and Gompertz-Makeham hazard models. We find that (1) actuarial aging in subsistence societies is similar to that of early Europe, (2) actuarial senescence has slowed in later European cohorts, (3) reductions in extrinsic mortality associate with slower actuarial aging in longitudinal samples, and (4) men senesce more rapidly than women, especially in later cohorts. To interpret these results, we attempt to bridge population-based evolutionary analysis with individual-level proximate mechanisms.},

abstract = {The proopiomelanocortin gene (POMC) is expressed in the pituitary gland and the ventral hypothalamus of all jawed vertebrates, producing several bioactive peptides that function as peripheral hormones or central neuropeptides, respectively. We have recently determined that mouse and human POMC expression in the hypothalamus is conferred by the action of two 5' distal and unrelated enhancers, nPE1 and nPE2. To investigate the evolutionary origin of the neuronal enhancer nPE2, we searched available vertebrate genome databases and determined that nPE2 is a highly conserved element in placentals, marsupials, and monotremes, whereas it is absent in nonmammalian vertebrates. Following an in silico paleogenomic strategy based on genome-wide searches for paralog sequences, we discovered that opossum and wallaby nPE2 sequences are highly similar to members of the superfamily of CORE-short interspersed nucleotide element (SINE) retroposons, in particular to MAR1 retroposons that are widely present in marsupial genomes. Thus, the neuronal enhancer nPE2 originated from the exaptation of a CORE-SINE retroposon in the lineage leading to mammals and remained under purifying selection in all mammalian orders for the last 170 million years. Expression studies performed in transgenic mice showed that two nonadjacent nPE2 subregions are essential to drive reporter gene expression into POMC hypothalamic neurons, providing the first functional example of an exapted enhancer derived from an ancient CORE-SINE retroposon. In addition, we found that this CORE-SINE family of retroposons is likely to still be active in American and Australian marsupial genomes and that several highly conserved exonic, intronic and intergenic sequences in the human genome originated from the exaptation of CORE-SINE retroposons. Together, our results provide clear evidence of the functional novelties that transposed elements contributed to their host genomes throughout evolution.},

Ecologists find it useful in determining whether a species can survive when introduced into a new environment. Furthermore, the model can also be used to determine whether the population of a given species will increase or decrease over a certain period of time. We have gained an understanding of the construction and contents of the Leslie Matrix population model.

abstract = {Humans use spoken vocalizations, or their signed equivalent, as a physical support to carry language. This support is highly organized: vocalizations are built with the re-use of a small number of articulatory units, which are themselves discrete elements carved up by each linguistic community in the articulatory continuum. Moreover, the repertoires of these elementary units (the gestures, the phonemes, the morphemes) have a number of structural regularities: for example, while our vocal tract allows physically the production of hundreds of vowels, each language uses most often 5, and never more than 20 of them. Also, certain vowels are very frequent, like /a,e,i,o,u/, and some others are very rare, like /en/. All the speakers of a given linguistic community categorize the speech sounds in the same manner, and share the same repertoire of vocalizations. Speakers of different communities may have very different ways of categorizing sounds (for example, Chinese use tones to distinguish sounds), and repertoires of vocalizations. Such an organized physical support of language is crucial for the existence of language, and thus asking how it may have appeared in the biological and/or cultural history of humans is a fundamental questions. In particular, one can wonder how much the evolution of human speech codes relied on specific evolutionary innovations, and thus how difficult (or not) it was for speech to appear.},

We have further built heterogeneous habitat landscapes to study the adaptive dynamics of the bacterial metapopulations. By patterning habitat differences across the landscape, our device physically implements an adaptive landscape. In landscapes with higher niche diversity, we observe rapid adaptation to large-scale, low-quality (high-stress) areas.

In the space of one generation from its inception, systematic grammatical structure has emerged in the language. Going beyond a conventionalized list of words for actions, objects, people, characteristics, and so on, a systematic way of marking the grammatical relations among those elements has appeared in the form of highly regular word order. These systematic structures cannot be attributed to influence from other languages, because the particular word orders that appear in Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language differ from those found both in the ambient spoken languages in the community and in the other sign language found predominantly in the surrounding area. Therefore, the emerging grammatical structures should be regarded as an independent development within the language.},

abstract = {Epistasis for fitness means that the selective effect of a mutation is conditional on the genetic background in which it appears. Although epistasis is widely observed in nature, our understanding of its consequences for evolution by natural selection remains incomplete. In particular, much attention focuses only on its influence on the instantaneous rate of changes in frequency of selected alleles via epistatic contribution to the additive genetic variance for fitness. Thus, in this framework epistasis only has evolutionary importance if the interacting loci are simultaneously segregating in the population. However, the selective accessibility of mutational trajectories to high fitness genotypes may depend on the genetic background in which novel mutations appear, and this effect is independent of population polymorphism at other loci. Here we explore this second influence of epistasis on evolution by natural selection. We show that it is the consequence of a particular form of epistasis, which we designate sign epistasis. Sign epistasis means that the sign of the fitness effect of a mutation is under epistatic control; thus, such a mutation is beneficial on some genetic backgrounds and deleterious on others. Recent experimental innovations in microbial systems now permit assessment of the fitness effects of individual mutations on multiple genetic backgrounds. We review this literature and identify many examples of sign epistasis, and we suggest that the implications of these results may generalize to other organisms. These theoretical and empirical considerations imply that strong genetic constraint on the selective accessibility of trajectories to high fitness genotypes may exist and suggest specific areas of investigation for future research.},

Simulation can be viewed as another kind of experimental system and should be analyzed as such. Here, I argue that current discussions in the philosophy of science and in the physical sciences fields about the use of simulation as an experimental system have important implications for biology, especially complex sciences such as evolution and ecology. Simulation models can be used to mimic complex systems, but unlike nature, can be manipulated in ways that would be impossible, too costly or unethical to do in natural systems.

abstract = {Population sample data are complex; inference and prediction require proper accommodation of not only the nonlinear interactions that determine the expected future abundance, but also the stochasticity inherent in data and variable (often unobserved) environmental factors. Moreover, censuses may occur sporadically, and observation errors change with sample methods and effort. The state variable (usually density or abundance) may be hidden from view and known only through highly indirect observational schemes (such as public health records, hunting reports, or fossil/archeological surveys). We extend the basic state-space model for time-series analysis to accommodate these dominant sources of variability that influence population data. Using examples, we show how different types of process error and observation error, unequal sample intervals, and missing values can be accounted for within the flexible framework of Bayesian state-space models. We provide algorithms based on Gibbs sampling that can be used to obtain posterior estimates of population states and of model parameters. For models that can be linearized, results can be used for direct sampling of the posterior, including those with missing values and unequal sample intervals. For nonlinear models, we make use of Metropolis-Hastings within the Gibbs sampling framework. Examples derive from long-term census and population data. We illustrate the extension to discrete state variables with multiple stages using a Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (TSIR) model for mid 20th-century measles infection in London, where birth rates are assumed known, but susceptibles and infected individuals arise from imperfect reporting},

It has been pointed out (B. G. Hall, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 178:1-6, 1999; M. C. Orencia, J. S. Yoon, J. E. Ness, W. P. Stemmer, and R. C. Stevens, Nat. Struct. Biol. 8:238-242, 2001) that the power of DNA shuffling might be applied to the problem of predicting evolution in nature from in vitro evolution in the laboratory. As a predictor of natural evolutionary processes, that power may be misleading because in nature mutations almost always arise one at a time, and each advantageous mutation must be fixed into the population by an evolutionary pathway that leads from the wild type to the fully evolved sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce each of Stemmer's six substitutions into TEM-1, the best single mutant was chosen, and each of the remaining five substitutions was introduced. Repeated rounds of site-directed mutagenesis and selection of the best mutant were used in an attempt to construct a pathway between the wild-type TEM-1 and Stemmer's mutant with six mutations. In the present study it is shown (i) that no such pathway exists between the wild-type TEM-1 and the supereffective cefotaxime-hydrolyzing mutant that was generated by six amino acid substitutions via DNA shuffling (Stemmer, Nature 370:389-390, 1994) but that a pathway to a fourfold more efficient enzyme resulting from four of the same substitutions does exist, and (ii) that the more efficient enzyme is likely to arise in nature as the result of a single mutation in the naturally occurring TEM-52 allele.},

They have been used as crude indicators of population structure and migration events, and to subdivide samples for epidemiological purposes. In societies that use patrilineal surnames, a surname should correlate with a type of Y chromosome, provided certain assumptions are met.

abstract = {We explore how evolutionary game dynamics have to be modified to accomodate a mathematical framework for the evolution of language. In particular, we are interested in the evolution of vocabulary, that is associations between signals and objects. We assume that successful communication contributes to biological fitness: individuals who communicate well leave more offspring. Children inherit from their parents a strategy for language learning (a language acquisition device). We consider three mechanisms whereby language is passed from one generation to the next: (i) parental learning: children learn the language of their parents; (ii) role model learning: children learn the language of individuals with a high payoff; and (iii) random learning: children learn the language of randomly chosen individuals. We show that parental and role model learning outperform random learning. Then we introduce mistakes in language learning and study how this process changes language over time. Mistakes increase the overall efficacy of parental and role model learning: in a world with errors evolutionary adaptation is more efficient. Our model also provides a simple explanation why homonomy is common while synonymy is rare.},

@article{Young1999,
abstract = {Since the inherent uncertainty associated with most environmental and climatic systems is often acknowledged, it is surprising that most mathematical models of such systems are large, complex and completely deterministic in nature. In this situation, it seems sensible to consider alternative modelling methodologies which overtly acknowledge the often poorly defined nature of such systems and attempt to find simpler, stochastic descriptions which are more appropriate to the often limited data and information base. This paper considers one such approach, Data-based Mechanistic (DBM) modelling, and demonstrates how it can be useful not only for the modelling of environmental and other systems directly from time series data, but also as an approach to the evaluation and simplification of large deterministic simulation models. To achieve these objectives, the DBM approach exploits various methodological tools, including advanced methods of statistical identification and estimation; a particular form of Generalised Sensitivity Analysis based on Monte Carlo Simulation; and Dominant Mode Analysis, the latter involving a new statistical approach to combined model linearisation and order reduction. These various techniques are outlined in the paper and they are applied to the stochastic modelling of water pollution in rivers and the evaluation of nonlinear global carbon cycle models.},

abstract = {We consider the impact of a colonization process on the genetic diversity and spatial structure of a geographically subdivided population. A stepping-stone model combined with coales- cence theory is used to predict the evolution of sequence divergence and genetic parameters. We first derive analytical results for coalescence times in a population undergoing logistic growth. We next consider a stepping-stone model in which demes are successively colonized, starting from a first deme at one of the borders of the metapopulation. We use recurrence equations to calculate coalescence times for two genes chosen either inside the same deme or in different demes. This allows us to obtain the distribution and the expectation of the coalescence times, and to deduce from them the distribution of the average pairwise differences and the evolution of Fst . Our results reflect the impact of the founder effect, which becomes stronger as the distance of the deme from the first deme increases. An increase in migration rate or growth rate generally leads to a decrease of the founder effect. Fst (i) increases during the beginning of the colonization, (ii) decreases when migration creates homogenization and (iii) increases again towards an equilibrium value. The distributions of pairwise coalescence times or differences between sequences show a peak corresponding to the colonization period. These results could help detect former colonization events in natural populations.},

abstract = {Gene expression plays a central role in the orchestration of cellular processes. The use of inducible promoters to change the expression level of a gene from its physiological level has significantly contributed to the understanding of the functioning of regulatory networks. However, from a quantitative point of view, their use is limited to short-term, population-scale studies to average out cell-to-cell variability and gene expression noise and limit the nonpredictable effects of internal feedback loops that may antagonize the inducer action. Here, we show that, by implementing an external feedback loop, one can tightly control the expression of a gene over many cell generations with quantitative accuracy. To reach this goal, we developed a platform for real-time, closed-loop control of gene expression in yeast that integrates microscopy for monitoring gene expression at the cell level, microfluidics to manipulate the cells' environment, and original software for automated imaging, quantification, and model predictive control. By using an endogenous osmostress responsive promoter and playing with the osmolarity of the cells environment, we show that long-term control can, indeed, be achieved for both time-constant and time-varying target profiles at the population and even the single-cell levels. Importantly, we provide evidence that real-time control can dynamically limit the effects of gene expression stochasticity. We anticipate that our method will be useful to quantitatively probe the dynamic properties of cellular processes and drive complex, synthetically engineered networks.},

abstract = {Invasion speeds can be calculated from ma- trix integrodifference equation models that incorporate stage-specific demography and dispersal. Thesemodels also permit the calculation of the sensitivity and elas- ticity of invasion speed to changes in demographic and dispersal parameters. Such calculations have been used to understand the factors determining invasion speed and to explore possible tactics to manage invasive species. In this paper, we extend these calculations to temporally varying environments.We present formulas for the invasion speed and its sensitivity and elasticity in both periodic and stochastic environments. Periodic models can describe seasonal variation within a year, or can be used to study the frequency of occurrence of events (e.g., floods, fires) on interannual time scales. Stochastic models can incorporate variances, covari- ances, and temporal autocorrelation of parameters. We show that the invasion speed is calculated from a growth rate which is in turn calculated from a periodic or stochastic product of moment-generating function matrices. We present a new formulation of sensitivity analysis, using matrix calculus, that applies equally to constant, periodic, and stochastic environments.},

@article{Goldstein2010,
abstract = {In this paper, I re-introduce the Gompertz model of age-specific fertility. This model has been rejected by past authors as fitting poorly to cross-sectional, or period rates. However, I find that the model fits very well to recent medium and low fertility cohort schedules in France, Italy, and Japan. A distinct advantage of the Gompertz model is that it has a simple behavioral interpretation as the result of social diffusion of fertility behavior in a cohort competing with the fertility-depressing effects of older age. The Gompertz model, and further refinements that include a better specification of the biological limits of childbearing, offer a means for forecasting future fertility, describing temporal change, and assessing the fertility-limiting effects of older entry into motherhood. In addition, the Gompertz function allows for traditional uses of model age-schedules such as smoothing and correction of data. The model estimates the completed cohort fertility of French, Japanese, and Italian cohorts born in 1965 to be 2.0 , 1.6, and 1.6, respectively. For France, this represents only a minor decline from earlier cohorts, but for Japan the decline in cohort fertility is marked. The model with infertility suggests that recent decline in Italy is largely due to shifts to older ages of childbearing.},

abstract = {We consider discrete time linear population models of the form n (t + 1) = An (t) where A is a population projection matrix or integral projection operator, and n (t) represents a structured population at time t. It is well known that the asymptotic growth or decay rate of n (t) is determined by the leading eigenvalue of A. In practice, population models have substantial parameter uncertainty, and it might be difficult to quantify the effect of this uncertainty on the leading eigenvalue. For a large class of matrices and integral operators A, we give sufficient conditions for an eigenvalue to be the leading eigenvalue. By preselecting the leading eigenvalue to be equal to 1, this allows us to easily identify, which combination of parameters, within the confines of their uncertainty, lead to asymptotic growth, and which lead to asymptotic decay. We then apply these results to the analysis of uncertainty in both a matrix model and an integral model for a population of thistles. We show these results can be generalized to any preselected leading eigenvalue. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Understanding the genetic structure of the European population is important, not only from a historical perspective, but also for the appropriate design and interpretation of genetic epidemiological studies. Previous population genetic analyses with autosomal markers in Europe either had a wide geographic but narrow genomic coverage [1, 2], or vice versa [3-6]. We therefore investigated Affymetrix GeneChip 500K genotype data from 2,514 individuals belonging to 23 different subpopulations, widely spread over Europe. Although we found only a low level of genetic differentiation between subpopulations, the existing differences were characterized by a strong continent-wide correlation between geographic and genetic distance. Furthermore, mean heterozygosity was larger, and mean linkage disequilibrium smaller, in southern as compared to northern Europe. Both parameters clearly showed a clinal distribution that provided evidence for a spatial continuity of genetic diversity in Europe. Our comprehensive genetic data are thus compatible with expectations based upon European population history, including the hypotheses of a south-north expansion and/or a larger effective population size in southern than in northern Europe. By including the widely used CEPH from Utah (CEU) samples into our analysis, we could show that these individuals represent northern and western Europeans reasonably well, thereby confirming their assumed regional ancestry.},

The versatility and attractiveness of the wavelet approach lie in its decomposition properties, principally its time-scale localization. It is especially relevant to the analysis of non-stationary systems, i.e., systems with short-lived transient components, like those observed in ecological systems. Here, we review the basic properties of the wavelet approach for time-series analysis from an ecological perspective. Wavelet decomposition offers several advantages that are discussed in this paper and illustrated by appropriate synthetic and ecological examples. Wavelet analysis is notably free from the assumption of stationarity that makes most methods unsuitable for many ecological time series. Wavelet analysis also permits analysis of the relationships between two signals, and it is especially appropriate for following gradual change in forcing by exogenous variables.},

In principle, evolution to this high-resistance beta-lactamase might follow any of the 120 mutational trajectories linking these alleles. However, we demonstrate that 102 trajectories are inaccessible to Darwinian selection and that many of the remaining trajectories have negligible probabilities of realization, because four of these five mutations fail to increase drug resistance in some combinations. Pervasive biophysical pleiotropy within the beta-lactamase seems to be responsible, and because such pleiotropy appears to be a general property of missense mutations, we conclude that much protein evolution will be similarly constrained. This implies that the protein tape of life may be largely reproducible and even predictable.},

abstract = {We consider a class of nonlinear Leslie matrix models, describing the population dynamics of an age-structured semelparous species. Semelparous species are those whose individuals reproduce only once and die afterwards. Competitive interaction between individuals is modelled via a one-dimensional environmental quantity. Age classes are characterised by their impact on, and their sensitivity to, the environment. We do not restrict ourselves to some particular form of functional dependence and keep the model otherwise as general as possible.The system possesses a cyclic symmetry. Due to the symmetry it exhibits so-called vertical bifurcations, where a manifold filled with periodic orbits appears in the phase space for specific parameter combinations. This bifurcation serves as a switch between the main types of behaviour: coexistence of all year classes or a periodic regime with some year classes missing. In particular, the vertical bifurcation takes place when a certain circulant matrix is singular.We also analyse the local stability of the unique coexistence equilibrium state and derive a characteristic equation for it. The dynamics of populations with two and, especially, with three age classes are analysed in detail. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Timed picture naming was compared in seven languages that vary along dimensions known to affect lexical access. Analyses over items focused on factors that determine cross-language universals and cross-language disparities. With regard to universals, number of alternative names had large effects on reaction time within and across languages after target-name agreement was controlled, suggesting inhibitory effects from lexical competitors. For all the languages, word frequency and goodness of depiction had large effects, but objective picture complexity did not. Effects of word structure variables (length, syllable structure, compounding, and initial frication) varied markedly over languages. Strong cross-language correlations were found in naming latencies, frequency, and length. Other-language frequency effects were observed (e.g., Chinese frequencies predicting Spanish reaction times) even after within-language effects were controlled (e.g., Spanish frequencies predicting Spanish reaction times). These surprising cross-language correlations challenge widely held assumptions about the lexical locus of length and frequency effects, suggesting instead that they may (at least in part) reflect familiarity and accessibility at a conceptual level that is shared over languages.},

abstract = {Demographic perturbation analysis explores how population statistics (es- pecially population growth rate ?) respond to changes in the vital rates (survival, growth, development, reproduction, and so on). Perturbation analysis is used in two logically distinct ways. Prospective analyses (sensitivity and elasticity) explore the functional dependence of ? on the vital rates. They predict the changes in ? that would result from any specified change in the vital rates and are independent of previous patterns of variability of the vital rates. Retrospective analyses (life table response experiment [LTRE] methods and other kinds of variance decomposition) express observed variation in ? as a function of observed (co)variation in the vital rates. Their results are specific to the observed pattern of variation. Sensitivity and elasticity analysis can be used to identify potential management targets because changes in vital rates with high sensitivity or elasticity will produce large changes in ?. Sometimes that potential may not be realized because it is difficult or impossible to change those vital rates. Retrospective analyses cannot identify potential management tar- gets because they compare the contributions of past changes in vital rates, not the effects of future changes. Just as the results of heritability analysis say nothing about the efficacy of clinical treatments, so the results of retrospective analysis say nothing about the efficacy of potential management tactics. Perturbation analysis is a powerful tool with important implications for conservation. It is important that perturbation analyses be applied properly.},

abstract = {Fitness is a vague, poorly developed concept in ecology and evolutionary biology. Although it is generally recognized that fitness is determined by the complete survival and reproductive schedules of individual organisms, experimental studies have rarely attempted to integrate these into a single measure of individual fitness. Instead, particularly in studies of natural selection, components of fitness are measured as surrogates for fitness. In this article, we develop an integrated measure of fitness based on the philosophical underpinnings provided by the notion of propensity fitness, combined with classical demographic methods. We show how life-history data, collected for an individual, can be formatted as an age-structured population projection matrix, A((m)). The dominant eigenvalue, lambda((m)), of this matrix is an estimate of that individual's propensity fitness. Using life-history data sets on European sparrowhawks and blue tits, we show that the interpretation of analyses of selection can shift radically using the integrated propensity fitness measure instead of components of fitness, such as lifetime reproductive output. Individual fitness, as formulated here, provides an integrated measure of performance that should prove useful in empirical studies in ecology and evolutionary biology.},

Our results suggest that some of the decline of tuberculosis is simply due to the natural behaviour of an epidemic. Although other factors must also have contributed to the decline, these causal factors were constrained to operate within the slow response time dictated by the intrinsic dynamics.},

Two main types of statistical methodology are commonly used to deal with the gigantic amount of data: either a multifactorial data approach which synthetizes the information from several genes in a small number of principal components or an analysis of the individual pattern of each gene which relies on the calculation of spatial autocorrelations and such statistical techniques.

@article{Caswell1978a,
abstract = {There is now convincing evidence, from a variety of ecological systems, that predation is capable of maintaining coexistence among a set of competing prey species, some of which would be excluded in its absence. This interaction has been suggested as a major factor determining the structure of some communities, but attempts to incorporate it into the mathematical framework of population theory have been frustrating. Although the possibility of predator-mediated coexistence is easily shown, parameter-space studies of simple three-species models suggest that it is an improbable occurrence, requiring a very delicate balancing of parameter values. To attack this problem, I classify population systems as open or closed, and equilibrium or nonequilibrium. Closed systems consist of a single homogeneous patch of habitat; open systems, in their simplest form, are a collection of such patches (or cells) connected by migration. Equilibrium theories are restricted to behavior at or near an equilibrium point, while nonequilibrium theories explicitly consider the transient behavior of the system. Almost all of the work on predator-mediated coexistence has been limited to closed, equilibrium systems. In such studies conditions are sought which guarantee that predation results in a stable equilibrium at which all species are present. A general property of open systems is that transient, nonequilibrium behaviors may persist for extremely long periods of time. A model is presented which uses this fact to generate long-term, but nonequilibrial, coexistence among competitors under the impact of predation. The model is a discrete, or logical, model, in which presence and absence of each of two competitors and a predator is followed in a set of stochastically connected local population cells. The predator acts to open up new cells for nonequilibrium growth of the prey species. All forms of predator-mediated coexistence other than the open-system, nonequilibrium effect were purposely eliminated from the model. The results of the model clearly demonstrate the possibility of long-term predator-mediated coexistence in such a system. In spite of stacking the deck against it, the positive effect of the predator on coexistence is statistically highly significant. Moreover, a crude evolutionary analysis suggests that the effect is not only possible, but probable. These results can be generalized far beyond the highly abstracted framework of the model. Such generalizations suggest that this phenomenon may be of major importance in natural systems. The predictions of the model can be tested against the real world in several ways. First, it predicts the possibility of predator-mediated coexistence, which agrees with the numerous observations of that phenomenon. More importantly, it makes predictions (concerning the spatial and temporal organization of the predation process) that distinguish it from the other modes of predator-mediated coexistence. These predictions are corroborated by observations of a number of cases where predation has failed to generate coexistence. The distinction between closed and open, equilibrium and nonequilibrium, population systems has an important impact on the form and substance of ecological theory.},

abstract = {Studies of time-invariant matrix metapopulation models indicate that metapopulation growth rate is usually more sensitive to the vital rates of individuals in high-quality (i.e., good) patches than in lowquality (i.e., bad) patches. This suggests that, given a choice, management efforts should focus on good rather than bad patches. Here, we examine the sensitivity of metapopulation growth rate for a two-patch matrix metapopulation model with and without stochastic disturbance and found cases where managers can more efficiently increase metapopulation growth rate by focusing efforts on the bad patch. In our model, net reproductive rate differs between the two patches so that in the absence of dispersal, one patch is high quality and the other low quality. Disturbance, when present, reduces net reproductive rate with equal frequency and intensity in both patches. The stochastic disturbance model gives qualitatively similar results to the deterministic model. In most cases, metapopulation growth rate was elastic to changes in net reproductive rate of individuals in the good patch than the bad patch. However, when the majority of individuals are located in the bad patch, metapopulation growth rate can be most elastic to net reproductive rate in the bad patch. We expand the model to include two stages and parameterize the patches using data for the softshell clam, Mya arenaria. With a two-stage demographic model, the elasticities of metapopulation growth rate to parameters in the bad patch increase, while elasticities to the same parameters in the good patch decrease. Metapopulation growth rate is most elastic to adult survival in the population of the good patch for all scenarios we examine. If the majority of the metapopulation is located in the bad patch, the elasticity to parameters of that population increase but do not surpass elasticity to parameters in the good patch. This model can be expanded to include additional patches,multiple stages, stochastic dispersal, and complex demography.},

abstract = {Language is the best example of a cultural evolutionary system, able to retain a phylogenetic signal over many thousands of years. The temporal stability (conservatism) of basic vocabulary is relatively well understood, but the stability of the structural properties of language (phonology, morphology, syntax) is still unclear. Here we report an extensive Bayesian phylogenetic investigation of the structural stability of numerous features across many language families and we introduce a novel method for analyzing the relationships between the "stability profiles" of language families. We found that there is a strong universal component across language families, suggesting the existence of universal linguistic, cognitive and genetic constraints. Against this background, however, each language family has a distinct stability profile, and these profiles cluster by geographic area and likely deep genealogical relationships. These stability profiles seem to show, for example, the ancient historical relationships between the Siberian and American language families, presumed to be separated by at least 12,000 years, and possible connections between the Eurasian families. We also found preliminary support for the punctuated evolution of structural features of language across families, types of features and geographic areas. Thus, such higher-level properties of language seen as an evolutionary system might allow the investigation of ancient connections between languages and shed light on the peopling of the world.},

abstract = {Carbon removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis is released back by respiration. Although some organic carbon is degraded quickly, older carbon persists; consequently carbon stocks are much larger than predicted by initial decomposition rates. This disparity can be traced to a wide range of first-order decay-rate constants, but the rate distributions and the mechanisms that determine them are unknown. Here, we pose and solve an inverse problem to find the rate distributions corresponding to the decomposition of plant matter throughout North America. We find that rate distributions are lognormal, with a mean and variance that depend on climatic conditions and substrate. Changes in temperature and precipitation scale all rates similarly, whereas the initial substrate composition sets the time scale of faster rates. These findings probably result from the interplay of stochastic processes and biochemical kinetics, suggesting that the intrinsic variability of decomposers, substrate and environment results in a predictable distribution of rates. Within this framework, turnover times increase exponentially with the kinetic heterogeneity of rates, thereby providing a theoretical expression for the persistence of recalcitrant organic carbon in the natural environment.},

abstract = {Theoretical works have shed light on the impact of natural selection in shaping phenotypes and genotypes. Wagner's canalization model (Wagner, 1996) is one of the well-established models which describe emergent properties of evolving gene networks. In this paper, we propose a deeper theoretical understanding of this well-studied model and we extend its conclusions by characterizing new emergent properties of evolving networks. We start with the review of the Wagner model and its applications to robustness of gene networks, gene duplication and evolution of sexual reproduction. Then, we perform a mathematical analysis to gain a better understanding of the model evolutionary dynamics. Doing so paves the way to study systematically the impact of mutation rates on compatibility of genotypes, variability of phenotypes and viability of offspring in evolving populations. Finally, we derive new observations concerning two emergent properties concerning evolved genomes robustness. First, we show that selecting for development towards a specific phenotype also contributes to enhance the stability of other alternative phenotypes which can be revealed under stress. Second, we find that this generalized canalization also renders gene networks more robust towards gene deletion, loss of interactions, perturbations of regulation activity and mutations. Therefore, not only evolution selects for individuals robust to types of perturbation they have faced in previous generations, but also robust to types of perturbations they have never experienced.},

The Modern Maltese preserved the memory of two Proto-Semitic roots, *'ada{\v{s}}- ('lentil') and *pūl- ('field bean'). The presented results prove that the most ancient Eurasian pulse crops were well-known and extensively cultivated by the ancestors of all modern European nations. The attested lexicological continuum witnesses the existence of a millennia-long links between the peoples of Eurasia to their mutual benefit.

abstract = {Quality differences between offspring sired by the social and by an extra-pair partner are usually assumed to have a genetic basis, reflecting genetic benefits of female extra-pair mate choice. In the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), we identified a colour ornament that is under sexual selection and appears to have a heritable basis. Hence, by engaging in extra-pair copulations with highly ornamented males, females could, in theory, obtain genes for increased offspring attractiveness. Indeed, sons sired by extra-pair partners had larger ornaments, seemingly supporting the genetic benefit hypothesis. Yet, when comparing ornament size of the social and extra-pair partners, there was no difference. Hence, the observed differences most likely had an environmental basis, mediated, for example, via differential maternal investment of resources into the eggs fertilized by extra-pair and social partners. Such maternal effects may (at least partly) be mediated by egg size, which we found to be associated with mean ornament expression in sons. Our results are consistent with the idea that maternal effects can shape sexual selection by altering the genotype-phenotype relationship for ornamentation. They also caution against automatically attributing greater offspring attractiveness or viability to an extra-pair mate's superior genetic quality, as without controlling for differential maternal investment we may significantly overestimate the role of genetic benefits in the evolution of extra-pair mating behaviour.},

Nonetheless, breast-feeding and complementary feeding practices differ greatly from global recommendations. Although the World Health Organization recommends that infants receive solely breast milk for the first 6 months of life, only about one-third of infants in low-income countries meet this goal, just one-third of children 6 to 24 months old in low-income countries meet the minimum criteria for dietary diversity, and only one in five who are breast-fed receive a minimum acceptable diet. Although the potential effects of improved breast-feeding and complementary feeding appear large, funding for research and greater use of existing effective interventions seems low compared with other life-saving child health interventions.},

Genetic relatedness affects friendships. In species where males disperse, friendships are more likely among females. If females disperse, friendships are more likely among males. Not all friendships, however, depend on kinship; many are formed between unrelated individuals. Friendships often involve cooperative interactions that are separated in time. They depend, at least in part, on the memory and emotions associated with past interactions. Applying the term "friendship" to animals is not anthropomorphic: Many studies have shown that the animals themselves recognize others' relationships. Friendships are adaptive. Male allies have superior competitive ability and improved reproductive success; females with the strongest, most enduring friendships experience less stress, higher infant survival, and live longer.},

An alternative hypothesis claims that the languages spread from Anatolia with the expansion of farming 8000 to 9500 years ago. We used Bayesian phylogeographic approaches, together with basic vocabulary data from 103 ancient and contemporary Indo-European languages, to explicitly model the expansion of the family and test these hypotheses. We found decisive support for an Anatolian origin over a steppe origin. Both the inferred timing and root location of the Indo-European language trees fit with an agricultural expansion from Anatolia beginning 8000 to 9500 years ago.

abstract = {Assessments of the status of endangered species have focused on population sizes, often without knowledge of demographic and behavioral processes underlying population recovery. We analyzed demographic data from a 28-year study of a critically endangered primate, the northern muriqui, to investigate possible changes in demographic rates as this population recovered from near extirpation. As the population increased from 60 to nearly 300 individuals, its growth rate declined due to increased mortality and male-biased birth sex ratios; the increased mortality was not uniform across ages and sexes, and there has been a recent increase in mortality of prime-aged males. If not for a concurrent increase in fertility rates, the population would have stabilized at 200 individuals instead of continuing to grow. The unexpected increase in fertility rates and in adult male mortality can be attributed to the muriquis' expansion of their habitat by spending more time on the ground. The demographic consequences of this behavioral shift must be incorporated into management tactics for this population and emphasize the importance of understanding demographic rates in the recovery of endangered species.},

abstract = {The net reproductive rate R0 measures the expected lifetime reproductive output of an individual, and plays an important role in demography, ecology, evolution, and epidemiology. Well-established methods exist to calculate it from age- or stage-classified demographic data. As an expectation, R0 provides no information on variability; empirical measurements of lifetime reproduction universally show high levels of variability, and often positive skewness among individuals. This is often interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity, and thus of an opportunity for natural selection. However, variability provides evidence of heterogeneity only if it exceeds the level of variability to be expected in a cohort of identical individuals all experiencing the same vital rates. Such comparisons require a way to calculate the statistics of lifetime reproduction from demographic data. Here, a new approach is presented, using the theory of Markov chains with rewards, obtaining all the moments of the distribution of lifetime reproduction. The approach applies to age- or stage-classified models, to constant, periodic, or stochastic environments, and to any kind of reproductive schedule. As examples, I analyze data from six empirical studies, of a variety of animal and plant taxa (nematodes, polychaetes, humans, and several species of perennial plants).},

Models of concurrent systems with many components very quickly exceed the storage capacity of computing devices even when efficient data structures are used to minimize the cost of representing each state. Here, we show how population-based models that make use of a continuous approximation of the discrete behaviour can be used to efficiently analyse the temporal behaviour of very large systems via their collective dynamics.

abstract = {General models of the evolution of cooperation, altruism and other social behaviours have focused almost entirely on single traits, whereas it is clear that social traits commonly interact. We develop a general kin-selection framework for the evolution of social behaviours in multiple dimensions. We show that whenever there are interactions among social traits new behaviours can emerge that are not predicted by one-dimensional analyses. For example, a prohibitively costly cooperative trait can ultimately be favoured owing to initial evolution in other (cheaper) social traits that in turn change the cost-benefit ratio of the original trait. To understand these behaviours, we use a two-dimensional stability criterion that can be viewed as an extension of Hamilton's rule. Our principal example is the social dilemma posed by, first, the construction and, second, the exploitation of a shared public good. We find that, contrary to the separate one-dimensional analyses, evolutionary feedback between the two traits can cause an increase in the equilibrium level of selfish exploitation with increasing relatedness, while both social (production plus exploitation) and asocial (neither) strategies can be locally stable. Our results demonstrate the importance of emergent stability properties of multidimensional social dilemmas, as one-dimensional stability in all component dimensions can conceal multidimensional instability.},

abstract = {Thoughts and ideas are multidimensional and often concurrent, yet they can be expressed surprisingly well sequentially by the translation into language. This reduction of dimensions occurs naturally but requires memory and necessitates the existence of correlations, e.g., in written text. However, correlations in word appearance decay quickly, while previous observations of long-range correlations using random walk approaches yield little insight on memory or on semantic context. Instead, we study combinations of words that a reader is exposed to within a "window of attention," spanning about 100 words. We define a vector space of such word combinations by looking at words that co-occur within the window of attention, and analyze its structure. Singular value decomposition of the co-occurrence matrix identifies a basis whose vectors correspond to specific topics, or "concepts" that are relevant to the text. As the reader follows a text, the "vector of attention" traces out a trajectory of directions in this "concept space." We find that memory of the direction is retained over long times, forming power-law correlations. The appearance of power laws hints at the existence of an underlying hierarchical network. Indeed, imposing a hierarchy similar to that defined by volumes, chapters, paragraphs, etc. succeeds in creating correlations in a surrogate random text that are identical to those of the original text. We conclude that hierarchical structures in text serve to create long-range correlations, and use the reader's memory in reenacting some of the multidimensionality of the thoughts being expressed.},

@article{Trinkaus2005,
abstract = {Abstract Perceptions of the emergence and spread of modern humans have changed recently through the reanalysis of fossils, an improved geochronological framework, and the discovery of a few specimens. Early modern humans in various portions of the Old World exhibit complex and varying mosaics of archaic, modern, and regional morphological characteristics. On the basis of this pattern, in conjunction with the emerging chronology of the earliest modern humans, the paleontological data indicate an assimilation model for modern human origins, in which the earliest modern humans emerged in eastern Africa, dispersed briefly into southwestern Asia, and then subsequently spread into the remainder of Africa and southern Asia, eventually into higher latitude Eurasia. The earliest modern humans outside of the core area of eastern Africa can be understood only if a variable degree of admixture with regional groups of late archaic humans occurred. Current and expected fossil and molecular data are unlikely to illuminate the degree of assimilation that took place in most regions of the Old World. However, the current chronological and phylogenetic framework provides the basis for ongoing investigation of the nature of this Late Pleistocene transitional period.},

abstract = {Languages, like genes, provide vital clues about human history. The origin of the Indo-European language family is "the most intensively studied, yet still most recalcitrant, problem of historical linguistics". Numerous genetic studies of Indo-European origins have also produced inconclusive results. Here we analyse linguistic data using computational methods derived from evolutionary biology. We test two theories of Indo-European origin: the 'Kurgan expansion' and the 'Anatolian farming' hypotheses. The Kurgan theory centres on possible archaeological evidence for an expansion into Europe and the Near East by Kurgan horsemen beginning in the sixth millennium BP. In contrast, the Anatolian theory claims that Indo-European languages expanded with the spread of agriculture from Anatolia around 8,000-9,500 years bp. In striking agreement with the Anatolian hypothesis, our analysis of a matrix of 87 languages with 2,449 lexical items produced an estimated age range for the initial Indo-European divergence of between 7,800 and 9,800 years bp. These results were robust to changes in coding procedures, calibration points, rooting of the trees and priors in the bayesian analysis.},

abstract = {The behavior of neural networks may be influenced by transmission delays and many studies have derived constraints on parameters such as connection weights and output functions which ensure that the asymptotic dynamics of a network with delay remains similar to that of the corresponding system without delay. However, even when the delay does not affect the asymptotic behavior of the system, it may influence other important features in the system's dynamics such as the boundary of the basin of attraction of the stable equilibria. In order to better understand such effects, we study the dynamics of a system constituted by two neurons interconnected through delayed excitatory connections. We show that the system with delay has exactly the same stable equilibrium points as the associated system without delay, and that, in both the network with delay and the corresponding one without delay, most trajectories converge to these stable equilibria. Thus, the asymptotic behavior of the network with delay and that of the corresponding system without delay are similar. We obtain a theoretical characterization of the boundary separating the basins of attraction of two stable equilibria, which enables us to estimate the boundary. Our numerical investigations show that, even in this simple system, the boundary separting the basins of attraction of two stable equilibrium points depends on the value of the delays. The extension of these results to networks with an arbritrary number of units is discussed.},

abstract = {Human females stop reproducing long before they die. Among other mammals, only pilot and killer whales exhibit a comparable period of post-reproductive life. The grandmother hypothesis suggests that kin selection can favour post-reproductive survival when older females help their relatives to reproduce. But although there is an evidence that grandmothers can provide such assistance, it is puzzling why menopause should have evolved only among the great apes and toothed whales. We have previously suggested (Cant {\&} Johnstone 2008 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 105, 5332-5336 (doi:10.1073/pnas.0711911105)) that relatedness asymmetries owing to female-biased dispersal in ancestral humans would have favoured younger females in reproductive competition with older females, predisposing our species to the evolution of menopause. But this argument appears inapplicable to menopausal cetaceans, which exhibit philopatry of both sexes combined with extra-group mating. Here, we derive general formulae for 'kinship dynamics', the age-related changes in local relatedness that occur in long-lived social organisms as a consequence of dispersal and mortality. We show that the very different social structures of great apes and menopausal whales both give rise to an increase in local relatedness with female age, favouring late-life helping. Our analysis can therefore help to explain why, of all long-lived, social mammals, it is specifically among the great apes and toothed whales that menopause and post-reproductive helping have evolved.},

abstract = {Peptide hormones are small, processed, and secreted peptides that signal via membrane receptors and play critical roles in normal and pathological physiology. The search for novel peptide hormones has been hampered by their small size, low or restricted expression, and lack of sequence similarity. To overcome these difficulties, we developed a bioinformatics search tool based on the hidden Markov model formalism that uses several peptide hormone sequence features to estimate the likelihood that a protein contains a processed and secreted peptide of this class. Application of this tool to an alignment of mammalian proteomes ranked 90{\%} of known peptide hormones among the top 300 proteins. An analysis of the top scoring hypothetical and poorly annotated human proteins identified two novel candidate peptide hormones. Biochemical analysis of the two candidates, which we called spexin and augurin, showed that both were localized to secretory granules in a transfected pancreatic cell line and were recovered from the cell supernatant. Spexin was expressed in the submucosal layer of the mouse esophagus and stomach, and a predicted peptide from the spexin precursor induced muscle contraction in a rat stomach explant assay. Augurin was specifically expressed in mouse endocrine tissues, including pituitary and adrenal gland, choroid plexus, and the atrio-ventricular node of the heart. Our findings demonstrate the utility of a bioinformatics approach to identify novel biologically active peptides. Peptide hormones and their receptors are important diagnostic and therapeutic targets, and our results suggest that spexin and augurin are novel peptide hormones likely to be involved in physiological homeostasis.},

abstract = {Inhibition of mTOR signaling by rapamycin has been demonstrated to activate ERK1/2 and Akt in various types of cancer cells, which contributes to rapamycin resistance. However, the downstream effect of rapamycin-activated ERKs and Akt on survival or death substrate(s) remains unclear. We discovered that treatment of human lung cancer cells with rapamycin results in enhanced phosphorylation of Bad at serine (S) 112 and S136 but not S155 in association with activation of ERK1/2 and Akt. A higher level of Bad phosphorylation was observed in rapamycin-resistant cells compared to parental rapamycin-sensitive cells. Thus, Bad phosphorylation may contribute to rapamycin resistance. Mechanistically, rapamycin promotes Bad accumulation in the cytosol, enhances Bad/14-3-3 interaction and reduces Bad/Bcl-XL binding. Rapamycin-induced Bad phosphorylation promotes its ubiquitination and degradation, with a significant reduction of its half-life (i.e. from 53.3 h to 37.5 h). Inhibition of MEK/ERK by PD98059 or depletion of Akt by RNA interference blocks rapamycin-induced Bad phosphorylation at S112 or S136, respectively. Simultaneous blockage of S112 and S136 phosphorylation of Bad by PD98059 and silencing of Akt significantly enhances rapamycin-induced growth inhibition in vitro and synergistically increases the anti-tumor efficacy of rapamycin in lung cancer xenografts. Intriguingly, either suppression of Bad phosphorylation at S112 and S136 sites or expression of the non-phosphorylatable Bad mutant (S112A/S136A) can reverse rapamycin resistance. These findings uncover a novel mechanism of rapamycin resistance, which may promote the development of new strategies for overcoming rapamycin resistance by manipulating Bad phosphorylation at S112 and S136 in human lung cancer},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Early infant mortality has not declined as rapidly as child mortality in many countries. Identification of risk factors for early infant mortality may help inform the design of intervention strategies. METHODS: Over the period 1994-97, 15,469 live-born, singleton infants in rural Nepal were followed to 24 weeks of age to identify risk factors for mortality within 0-7 days, 8-28 days, and 4-24 weeks after the birth. FINDINGS: In multivariate models, maternal and paternal education reduced mortality between 4 and 24 weeks only: odds ratios (OR) 0.28 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.12-0.66) and 0.63 (95{\%} CI = 0.44-0.88), respectively. Miscarriage in the previous pregnancy predicted mortality in the first week of life (OR = 1.98, 95{\%} CI = 1.37-2.87), whereas prior child deaths increased the risk of post-neonatal death (OR = 1.85, 95{\%} CI 1.24-2.75). A larger maternal mid-upper arm circumference reduced the risk of infant death during the first week of life (OR = 0.88, 95{\%} CI = 0.81-0.95). Infants of women who did not receive any tetanus vaccinations during pregnancy or who had severe illness during the third trimester were more likely to die in the neonatal period. Maternal mortality was strongly associated with infant mortality (OR = 6.43, 95{\%} CI = 2.35-17.56 at 0-7 days; OR = 11.73, 95{\%} CI = 3.82-36.00 at 8-28 days; and OR = 51.68, 95{\%} CI = 20.26-131.80 at 4-24 weeks). CONCLUSION: Risk factors for early infant mortality varied with the age of the infant. Factors amenable to intervention included efforts aimed at maternal morbidity and mortality and increased arm circumference during pregnancy.},

abstract = {An unresolved question arising from human evolutionary research relates to the function of the postreproductive period in human females. If menopause is not merely an artifact resulting from the benefits of civilization, there must be an adaptive mechanism favoring the offspring of women who continue to thrive well past the time of their last ovulation. The "grandmother hypothesis" was developed on the basis of the original suggestion by Williams (1957 Evolution 11:32-39) that "stopping early" would benefit already-born children. This idea, combined with the concepts of kin selection (Hamilton 1964 J Theor Biol 7:1-52) and parental investment (Trivers 1972 Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man, Chicago: Aldine, p. 136-179), was expanded to suggest that postreproductive women (in contrast to males) contribute to their inclusive fitness by extending support to their grandchildren. We used discrete time event history analysis (Allison [1984] Event History Analysis, Newbury Park: Sage; Allison [1995] Survival Analysis, Cary, NC: SAS Institute) and logistic regression on data provided in population registers (Shūmon Aratame Chō, or SAC) from a village in central Japan, covering the period from 1671-1871, in a preliminary investigation of the effects of household grandparental presence on the probability of a child's death. We found that after accounting for the presence of other household members, the only grandparent whose presence exerted a consistent negative effect on the likelihood of a child's death was the mother's mother. Due to the small sample size of households that contained maternal grandmothers, these results failed to achieve statistical significance. Their importance, however, is in what they suggest about future research, i.e., census data from preindustrial societies can provide a basis for testing evolutionary proposals, including the "grandmother hypothesis."},

The purpose of this review is to draw together available empirical data on the demography of the primates. The data would identify the needs for additional empirical work and would begin the development of midlevel models of the evolution of primate life histories. In this review, the demographic systems (mortality and fertility estimates) for four broad groups of primates and their corresponding characteristics are presented and discussed. These four broad groups of primates include New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, chimpanzees, and humans. There may be differences in mortality among the four primate groups, but generally there appears to be a single mammalian mortality pattern which is relatively consistent among species. Mortality is high at birth and declines rapidly with age, typically reaching a minimum prior to reproductive maturity. Although the environmentally induced variation in human and nonhuman primate vital rates were explored, results were unsatisfactory. Data were not sufficient particularly with respect to nonhuman primate fertility. The human demographic system is least stable. It also implies that the Pan traglodyte demography was probably evolutionarily derived from the general primate pattern.},

Compte tenu de cette floraison bibliographique, il nous a quand m{\^{e}}me sembl{\'{e}} utile de remettre {\`{a}} disposition un livre qui conserve encore, aux dires de certains, quelques vertus p{\'{e}}dagogiques, malgr{\'{e}} ses dix ans d'{\^{a}}ge, m{\^{e}}me si cette qualit{\'{e}} s'applique plut{\^{o}}t aux single malts qu'aux manuels de phylog{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}tique.

abstract = {Reproductive senescence in human females takes place long before other body functions senesce. This fact presents an evolutionary dilemma since continued reproduction should generally be favored by natural selection. Two commonly proposed hypotheses to account for human menopause are (a) a recent increase in the human lifespan and (b) a switch to investment in close kin rather than direct reproduction. No support is found for the proposition that human lifespans have only recently increased. Data from Ache hunter-gatherers are used to test the kin selection hypothesis. Ache data do not support the proposition that females can gain greater fitness benefits in old age by helping kin rather than continuing to reproduce. Nevertheless, one crucial parameter in the model, when adjusted to the highest value within the measured 95{\%} confidence interval, would lead to the evolution of reproductive senescence at about 53 years of age. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether the kin selection hypothesis of menopause can account for its current maintenance in most populations.},

@article{Hamilton1971,
abstract = {This paper presents an antithesis to the view that gregarious behaviour is evolved through benefits to the population or species. Following Galton (1871) and Williams (1964) gregarious behaviour is considered as a form of cover-seeking in which each animal tries to reduce its chance of being caught by a predator. It is easy to see how pruning of marginal individuals can maintain centripetal instincts in already gregarious species; some evidence that marginal pruning actually occurs is summarized. Besides this, simply defined models are used to show that even in non-gregarious species selection is likely to favour individuals who stay close to others. Although not universal or unipotent, cover-seeking is a widespread and important element in animal aggregation, as the literature shows. Neglect of the idea has probably followed from a general disbelief that evolution can be dysgenic for a species. Nevertheless, selection theory provides no support for such disbelief in the case of species with outbreeding or unsubdivided populations. The model for two dimensions involves a complex problem in geometrical probability which has relevance also in metallurgy and communication science. Some empirical data on this, gathered from random number plots, is presented as of possible heuristic value. {\textcopyright} 1971.},

abstract = {The expression of a social behaviour may affect the fitness of actors and recipients living in the present and in the future of the population. When there is a risk that a future reward will not be experienced in such a context, the value of that reward should be discounted; but by how much? Here, we evaluate social discount rates for delayed fitness rewards to group of recipients living at different positions in both space and time than the actor in a hierarchically clustered population. This is a population where individuals are grouped into families, families into villages, villages into clans, and so on, possibly ad infinitum. The group-wide fitness effects are assumed to either increase or decrease the fecundity or the survival of recipients and can be arbitrarily extended in space and time. We find that actions changing the survival of individuals living in the future are generally more strongly discounted than fecundity-changing actions for all future times and that the value of future rewards increases as individuals live longer. We also find that delayed fitness effects may not only be discounted by a constant factor per unit delay (exponential discounting), but that, as soon as there is localized dispersal in a population, discounting per unit delay is likely to fall rapidly for small delays and then slowly for longer delays (hyperbolic discounting). As dispersal tends to be localized in natural populations, our results suggest that evolution is likely to favour individuals that express present-biased behaviours and that may be time-inconsistent with respect to their group-wide effects.},

abstract = {The evolution of a quantitative phenotype is often envisioned as a trait substitution sequence where mutant alleles repeatedly replace resident ones. In infinite populations, the invasion fitness of a mutant in this two-allele representation of the evolutionary process is used to characterize features about long-term phenotypic evolution, such as singular points, convergence stability (established from first-order effects of selection), branching points, and evolutionary stability (established from second-order effects of selection). Here, we try to characterize long-term phenotypic evolution in finite populations from this two-allele representation of the evolutionary process. We construct a stochastic model describing evolutionary dynamics at non-rare mutant allele frequency. We then derive stability conditions based on stationary average mutant frequencies in the presence of vanishing mutation rates. We find that the second-order stability condition obtained from second-order effects of selection is identical to convergence stability. Thus, in two-allele systems in finite populations, convergence stability is enough to characterize long-term evolution under the trait substitution sequence assumption. We perform individual-based simulations to confirm our analytic results.},

abstract = {Many traits and/or strategies expressed by organisms are quantitative phenotypes. Because populations are of finite size and genomes are subject to mutations, these continuously varying phenotypes are under the joint pressure of mutation, natural selection and random genetic drift. This article derives the stationary distribution for such a phenotype under a mutation-selection-drift balance in a class-structured population allowing for demographically varying class sizes and/or changing environmental conditions. The salient feature of the stationary distribution is that it can be entirely characterized in terms of the average size of the gene pool and Hamilton's inclusive fitness effect. The exploration of the phenotypic space varies exponentially with the cumulative inclusive fitness effect over state space, which determines an adaptive landscape. The peaks of the landscapes are those phenotypes that are candidate evolutionary stable strategies and can be determined by standard phenotypic selection gradient methods (e.g. evolutionary game theory, kin selection theory, adaptive dynamics). The curvature of the stationary distribution provides a measure of the stability by convergence of candidate evolutionary stable strategies, and it is evaluated explicitly for two biological scenarios: first, a coordination game, which illustrates that, for a multipeaked adaptive landscape, stochastically stable strategies can be singled out by letting the size of the gene pool grow large; second, a sex-allocation game for diploids and haplo-diploids, which suggests that the equilibrium sex ratio follows a Beta distribution with parameters depending on the features of the genetic system.},

abstract = {How have changes in communications technology affected the way that misinformation spreads through a population and persists? To what extent do differences in the architecture of social networks affect the spread of misinformation, relative to the rates and rules by which individuals transmit or eliminate different pieces of information (cultural traits)? Here, we use analytical models and individual-based simulations to study how a 'cultural load' of misinformation can be maintained in a population under a balance between social transmission and selective elimination of cultural traits with low intrinsic value. While considerable research has explored how network architecture affects percolation processes, we find that the relative rates at which individuals transmit or eliminate traits can have much more profound impacts on the cultural load than differences in network architecture. In particular, the cultural load is insensitive to correlations between an individual's network degree and rate of elimination when these quantities vary among individuals. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in communications technology may have influenced cultural evolution more strongly through changes in the amount of information flow, rather than the details of who is connected to whom.},

abstract = {The ability to control impulsive behaviour has been studied in animals with a standard test in which subjects need to choose the smaller of two food items in order to receive the larger one (reverse reward contingency). As a variety of mammals that have been tested so far (mostly primates) have great difficulties to solve the task, it has been proposed that it is generally cognitively demanding. However, according to an ecological approach to cognition, a species' ability to solve the task should not depend on its general cognitive abilities but on whether its ecology causes selective pressure on the ability to restrain foraging behaviour. We tested this hypothesis using the cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), a fish species that feeds against its preference in nature when engaging in cleaning interactions with so called 'client fish'. None of the eight tested individuals learned to choose a non-preferred item after 200 trials. In a subsequent test, one subject learned to respond correctly in a large or none contingency task (only the choice of the small food was rewarded). After a short re-experience treatment, this individual learned to solve the reverse reward task after 30 trials. In conclusion, we did not find support for the general idea that interactions with clients prepared cleaners to quickly solve a reverse reward test. However, the results suggest that the potential to solve a reverse reward contingency may not be restricted to mammals but could be present also in a fish species in which the problem of choosing a non-preferred food over a preferred one is an ever present challenge in nature.},

abstract = {Recent studies have detailed a remarkable degree of genetic and linguistic diversity in Northern Island Melanesia. Here we utilize that diversity to examine two models of genetic and linguistic coevolution. The first model predicts that genetic and linguistic correspondences formed following population splits and isolation at the time of early range expansions into the region. The second is analogous to the genetic model of isolation by distance, and it predicts that genetic and linguistic correspondences formed through continuing genetic and linguistic exchange between neighboring populations. We tested the predictions of the two models by comparing observed and simulated patterns of genetic variation, genetic and linguistic trees, and matrices of genetic, linguistic, and geographic distances. The data consist of 751 autosomal microsatellites and 108 structural linguistic features collected from 33 Northern Island Melanesian populations. The results of the tests indicate that linguistic and genetic exchange have erased any evidence of a splitting and isolation process that might have occurred early in the settlement history of the region. The correlation patterns are also inconsistent with the predictions of the isolation by distance coevolutionary process in the larger Northern Island Melanesian region, but there is strong evidence for the process in the rugged interior of the largest island in the region (New Britain). There we found some of the strongest recorded correlations between genetic, linguistic, and geographic distances. We also found that, throughout the region, linguistic features have generally been less likely to diffuse across population boundaries than genes. The results from our study, based on exceptionally fine-grained data, show that local genetic and linguistic exchange are likely to obscure evidence of the early history of a region, and that language barriers do not particularly hinder genetic exchange. In contrast, global patterns may emphasize more ancient demographic events, including population splits associated with the early colonization of major world regions.},

abstract = {To investigate the paternal population history of populations in Northern Island Melanesia, 685 paternally unrelated males from 36 populations in this region and New Guinea were analyzed at 14 regionally informative binary markers and 7 short tandem repeat (STR) loci from the nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome. Three newly defined binary markers (K6-P79, K7-P117, and M2-P87) aided in identifying considerable heterozygosity that would have otherwise gone undetected. Judging from their geographic distributions and network analyses of their associated STR profiles, 4 lineages appear to have developed in this region and to be of considerable age: K6-P79, K7-P117, M2-P87, and M2a-P22. The origins of K5-M230 and M-M4 are also confirmed as being located further west, probably in New Guinea. In the 25 adequately sampled populations, the number of different haplogroups ranged from 2 in the single most isolated group (the Aita of Bougainville), to 9, and measures of molecular diversity were generally not particularly low. The resulting pattern contradicts earlier findings that suggested far lower male-mediated diversity and gene exchange rates in the region. However, these earlier studies had not included the newly defined haplogroups. We could only identify a very weak signal of recent male Southeast Asian genetic influence ({\textless}10{\%}), which was almost entirely restricted to Austronesian (Oceanic)-speaking groups. This contradicts earlier assumptions on the ancestral composition of these groups and requires a revision of hypotheses concerning the settlement of the islands of the central Pacific, which commenced from this region.},

abstract = {With the increasing incidence of HIV and TB, motherless children are becoming a rapidly growing problem in Africa. However, few studies describe the survival patterns of these children. The aim of this study was to investigate the mortality of motherless children in urban and rural areas of Guinea-Bissau. Methods: A historical cohort study was set up in urban and rural areas in Guinea-Bissau. Motherless children were selected from two study cohorts under demographic surveillance since 1990. The relatives of 128 motherless children from the rural cohort and 192 from the urban area, as well as a total of 807 controls, were examined and interviewed. Results: Controlling for significant background factors revealed that motherless children had a markedly higher mortality than that of controls in both urban (mortality rate ratio (MR) 2.32 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.11-4.84)) and rural areas (MR = 4.16 (2.79-6.22)). Virtually all the excess mortality occurred among children under 2 y of age when their mother died. Few motherless children had been provided with surrogate breastfeeding. Conclusions: Since nearly all children in Guinea are breastfed until 2 y of age, premature weaning may be one of the major causes of the higher mortality rates observed among motherless children},

abstract = {Objective: We studied child survival in Rakai, Uganda where many children are fostered out or orphaned. Methods: Biological relatedness is measured as the average of the Wright's coefficients between each household member and the child. Instrumental variables for fostering include proportion of adult males in household, age and gender of household head. Control variables include SES, religion, polygyny, household size, child age, child birth size, and child HIV status. Results: Presence of both parents in the household increased the odds of survival by 28{\%}. After controlling for the endogeneity of child placement decisions in a multivariate model we found that lower biological relatedness of a child was associated with statistically significant reductions in child survival. The effects of biological relatedness on child survival tend to be stronger for both HIV- and HIV+ children of HIV+ mothers. Conclusions: Reductions in the numbers of close relatives caring for children of HIV+ mothers reduce child survival.},

abstract = {Questions concerning the common ancestors of all present-day humans have received considerable attention of late in both the scientific and lay communities. Princi- pally, this attention has focused on ‘Mitochondrial Eve,' defined to be the woman who lies at the confluence of our maternal ancestry lines, and who is believed to have lived 100,000–200,000 years ago. More recent attention has been given to our common paternal ancestor, ‘Y Chromo- some Adam,' who may have lived 35,000–89,000 years ago. However, if we consider not just our all-female and all-male lines, but our ancestors along all parental lines, it turns out that everyone on earth may share a common ancestor who is remarkably recent. This study introduces a large-scale, detailed computer model of recent human history which suggests that the commonancestor of everyone alive today very likely lived between 2,000 and 5,000 years ago. Furthermore, the model indicates that nearly everyone living a few thou- sand years prior to that time is either the ancestor of no one or of all living humans.},

abstract = {Complex interacting networks are observed in systems from such diverse areas as physics, biology, economics, ecology, and computer science. For example, economic or social interactions often organize themselves in complex network structures. Similar phenomena are observed in traffic flow and in communication networks as the internet. In current problems of the Biosciences, prominent examples are protein networks in the living cell, as well as molecular networks in the genome. On larger scales one finds networks of cells as in neural networks, up to the scale of organisms in ecological food webs. This book defines the field of complex interacting networks in its infancy and presents the dynamics of networks and their structure as a key concept across disciplines. The contributions present common underlying principles of network dynamics and their theoretical description and are of interest to specialists as well as to the non-specialized reader looking for an introduction to this new exciting field. Theoretical concepts include modeling networks as dynamical systems with numerical methods and new graph theoretical methods, but also focus on networks that change their topology as in morphogenesis and self-organization. The authors offer concepts to model network structures and dynamics, focussing on approaches applicable across disciplines.},

The loss of a mother leads to dramatic increases in the mortality of young children, especially during the first 2 years of life, while the loss of a father has a rather limited negative impact. Over time the relative importance of the loss of a mother increases sharply, thus affording strong, albeit indirect, evidence of their role for mortality reduction during the demographic transition. Heights of military conscripts are used to assess other elements of health unrelated to survival. Results suggest that orphans were noticeably shorter than non-orphans. Over time this effect diminishes thanks to increasingly effective public assistance for orphans.},

A depth to the basement map derived from depth conversion of theseismic lines, shows a rather smooth flat basement dipping 1-3[degree sign] to the S-SE. The low-amplitudebroad folds of the Molasse Basin and the external Plateau Jura are controlled by evaporitepillows or anticlines of Middle Triassic age. The high amplitude folds of the Haute Chaine Jura,however, are related to NW- or SE-vergent thrusts with at least kilometric dipslip displacementthat has doubled the entire Jurassic sequence.The Plateau Jura evaporite-related folds,located in the foreland, are interpreted as early-stage buckle folds. With further deformation, afault ramp nucleates and develops into thrust-related folds as observed in the Haute Chaine.Thus, within the fold-and-thrust belt, deformation increases toward the hinterland. In the MolasseBasin, however, low-amplitude folds represent an early deformation stage which could notdevelop further owing to the load of the overlying thick Tertiary clastic wedge.},

abstract = {Darwinian theory has yet to explain adequately the fact of sex. If males provide little or no aid to offspring, a high (up to 2-fold) extra average fitness has to emerge as a property of a sexual parentage if sex is to be stable. The advantage must presumably come from recombination but has been hard to identify. It may well lie in the necessity to recombine defenses to defeat numerous parasites. A model demonstrating this works best for contesting hosts whose defense polymorphisms are constrained to low mutation rates. A review of the literature shows that the predictions of parasite coevolution fit well with the known ecology of sex. Moreover, parasite coevolution is superior to previous models of the evolution of sex by supporting the stability of sex under the following challenging conditions: very low fecundity, realistic patterns of genotype fitness and changing environment, and frequent mutation to parthenogenesis, even while sex pays the full 2-fold cost.},

abstract = {This paper reports findings from a study of maternal mortality in Matlab, Bangladesh during the 1976-85 period. The study employed a multiple-step procedure to identify maternity-related deaths to all reproductive-aged women within the study area during this period. A total of 387 maternal deaths were identified, resulting in an overall maternal mortality ratio of 5.5 per 1,000 live births. The introduction of a family planning program in half of the Matlab study area led to a moderate but significant reduction in maternal mortality rates, relative to the comparison area. This appears to have been primarily due to a reduction in the overall number of pregnancies in the treatment area, since among women who became pregnant, mortality risks remained high. The results of this study underscore the need for a broad-based service strategy that includes but is not limited solely to family planning, in order to achieve significant reductions in maternal mortality levels in settings such as rural Bangladesh.},

abstract = {A genetical mathematical model is described which allows for inter- actions between relatives on one another's fitness. Making use of Wright's Coefficient of Relationship as the measure of the proportion of replica genes in a relative, a quantity is found which incorporates the maximizing property of Darwinian fitness. This quantity is named “inclusive fitness”. Species following the model should tend to evolve behaviour such that each organism appears to be attempting to maximize its inclusive fitness. This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behaviour and possibility of limited self-sacrifices. Special cases of the model are used to show (a) that selection in the social situations newly covered tends to be slower than classical selection, (b) how in populations of rather non-dispersive organisms the model may apply to genes affecting dispersion, and (c) how it may apply approximately to competition between relatives, for example, within sibships. Some artificialities of the model are discussed.},

abstract = {Although evidence that survival decreases with age in animal species is compelling, the existence of variation in aging rates across different populations of a given species is still questioned. Here, we compared aging rates of 22 pairs of ruminant species living in captive and free-ranging conditions. Based on the recent suggestion that feeding niche is a key factor influencing aging in captivity, we also investigated whether a species' natural diet influences the aging rates of captive ruminants relative to their wild conspecifics. We found that aging rate in a given species was higher under free-ranging conditions than in captivity, which provides the first evidence of consistent aging rate variation within species. Additionally, our study clearly demonstrates that differences in aging rates between captive and free-ranging ruminants increased as species were more specialized on grass diets. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The theory of robustness describes a system level property of evolutionary systems, which predicts tradeoffs of great interest for the systems biology of aging, such as accumulation of non-heritable damage, occurrence of fragilities and limitations in performance, optimized allocation of restricted resources and confined redundancies. According to the robustness paradigm cells and organisms evolved into a state of highly optimized tolerance (HOT), which provides robustness to common perturbations, but causes tradeoffs generally characterized as "robust yet fragile". This raises the question whether the ultimate cause of aging is more than a lack of adaptation, but an inherent fragility of complex evolutionary systems. Since robustness connects to evolutionary designs, consideration of this theory provides a deeper connection between evolutionary aspects of aging, mathematical models and experimental data. In this review several mechanisms influential for aging are re-evaluated in support of robustness tradeoffs. This includes asymmetric cell division improving performance and specialization with limited capacities to prevent and repair age-related damage, as well as feedback control mechanisms optimized to respond to acute stressors, but unable to halt nor revert aging. Improvement in robustness by increasing efficiencies through cellular redundancies in larger organisms alleviates some of the damaging effects of cellular specialization, which can be expressed in allometric relationships. The introduction of the robustness paradigm offers unique insights for aging research and provides novel opportunities for systems biology endeavors. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Individuals within populations can differ substantially in their life span and their lifetime reproductive success but such realized in- dividual variation in fitness components need not reflect underlying heritable fitness differences visible to natural selection. Even so, biologists commonly argue that large differences in fitness compo- nents are likely adaptive, resulting from and driving evolution by natural selection. To examine this argumentwe use unique formulas to compute exactly the variance in life span and in lifetime reproduc- tive success among individuals with identical (genotypic) vital rates (assuming a common genotype for all individuals). Such individuals have identicalfitnessbut vary substantially in their realized individual fitness components.Weshow by example that our computed varian- ces and corresponding simulated distribution of fitness components match those observed in real populations.Of course, (genotypic) vital rates in real populations are expected todiffer by small but evolution- arily important amounts among genotypes, but we show that such differences only modestly increase variances in fitness components. We conclude that observed differences in fitness components may likely be evolutionarily neutral, at least to the extent that they are indistinguishable from distributions generated by neutral processes. Important consequences of large neutral variation are the following: Heritabilities for fitness components are likely to be small (which is in fact the case), small selectivedifferences inlife historieswill be hardto measure, and the effects of random driftwill be amplified in natural populations by the large variances among individuals},

abstract = {All life processes are subject to time constraints. At the cellular level, damage repair and cell cycle arrest are interrelated, allowing sufficient time for repair prior to cell cycle progression. Organisms have evolved so that developmental timing is linked to environmental conditions, such as nutrient availability and predation. Recent results in mammals regarding species-specific differences in cell cycle arrest and DNA damage suggest that a stable cell cycle arrest is a feature of longer-lived species. The implication of these results is that longer-lived species delay cell cycle progression to a greater degree than shorter-lived species, allowing for higher fidelity repair. We suggest that the ability to devote longer periods of time to repair and maintenance is a key feature of longer-lived species, and that evolutionary pressure to complete repair and resume cell division is a determinant of species lifespan. Thus, time is a resource that must be managed by the organism to attempt to maximize the fidelity of repair while completing development and reproduction in the limited window of opportunity afforded by environmental pressures. This viewpoint on time as a resource has implications for theories regarding the aging process and the development of species lifespan.},

abstract = {It is commonly thought that temporal fluctuations in demographic parameters should be selected against because of the deleterious impacts variation can have on fitness. A critical underpinning of this prediction is the assumption that changes in environmental conditions map linearly into changes in demographic parameters over time. We detail why this assumption may often break down and why selection should not always favor buffering of demographic parameters against environmental stochasticity. To the contrary, nonlinear relationships between the environment and demographic performance can produce asymmetric temporal variation in demographic parameters that actually enhances fitness. We extend this result to structured populations using simulation and show that 'demographic lability' rather than 'buffering' may be adaptive, particularly in organisms with low juvenile or adult survival. Finally, we review previous ecological work, and indicate cases where 'demographic lability' may be adaptive, then conclude by identifying research that is needed to develop a theory of life-history evolution that encompasses both demographic buffering and lability.},

The value of the contract depends on the joint distribution of the default times of the underlying assets. Valuing a basket default swap often entails Monte Carlo simulation of these default times. For baskets of high-quality credits and for swaps that require multiple defaults to trigger payment, pricing the swap is a rare- event simulation problem. Joshi and Kainth (2004) introduced an innovative importance sampling technique for this problem that forces a predetermined number of defaults to occur on each path. This paper analyzes, extends and improves the Joshi-Kainth algorithm. We show that, in its original form, the algorithm can actually increase variance; we present an alternative that is guaranteed to reduce variance, even when defaults are not rare. Along the way, we provide a rigorous underpinning in a setting sufficiently general to include both the original method and the version proposed here.},

abstract = {A Boolean network model of the cell-cycle regulatory network of fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces Pombe) is constructed solely on the basis of the known biochemical interaction topology. Simulating the model in the computer faithfully reproduces the known activity sequence of regulatory proteins along the cell cycle of the living cell. Contrary to existing differential equation models, no parameters enter the model except the structure of the regulatory circuitry. The dynamical properties of the model indicate that the biological dynamical sequence is robustly implemented in the regulatory network, with the biological stationary state G1 corresponding to the dominant attractor in state space, and with the biological regulatory sequence being a strongly attractive trajectory. Comparing the fission yeast cell-cycle model to a similar model of the corresponding network in S. cerevisiae, a remarkable difference in circuitry, as well as dynamics is observed. While the latter operates in a strongly damped mode, driven by external excitation, the S. pombe network represents an auto-excited system with external damping.},

@article{Proaktor2008,
abstract = {The cost of reproduction can generate covariation between demographic rates that can potentially influence demography and population dynamics in long-lived iteroparous species. However, there has been relatively little work linking the survival cost of reproduction and population dynamics. The apparent scarcity of information on this important link is potentially due to covariation between vital rates, which can substantially influence fluctuations in population size. In this paper we examine the opportunity for survival costs of reproduction to leave a dynamic signature using a simulation model based broadly on an ungulate life history. We find that an increase in the cost delays the onset of reproduction and reduces reproductive rates of young, but not of prime-age, females. Accordingly, the number of offspring produced declines and the interval between reproductive events increases among young females experiencing high cost. These effects are translated to an age structure skewed toward young ages and reduced population density. These results suggest that, by delaying reproduction when conditions deteriorate, females protect their survival during the critical first three years of life, after which the negative effect of reproduction on survival declines. Unless conditions for reproduction are severe, it is not profitable to delay reproduction beyond age 3 years due to the high risk of death before having a chance to reproduce. We also demonstrate that lack of adjustment of reproductive strategies to elevated levels of the cost of reproduction, for example due to rapid changes in environmental conditions, results in lower average density and longevity compared to females that have sufficient time to adjust to changes in the cost. This suggests that even moderate costs of reproduction may have a major negative effect on population dynamics of ungulates.},

abstract = {Trade-offs are a core component of many evolutionary models, particularly those dealing with the evolution of life histories. In the present paper, we identify four topics of key importance for studies of the evolutionary biology of trade-offs. First, we consider the underlying concept of 'constraint'. We conclude that this term is typically used too vaguely and suggest that 'constraint' in the sense of a bias should be clearly distinguished from 'constraint' in the sense of proscribed combinations of traits or evolutionary trajectories. Secondly, we address the utility of the acquisition-allocation model (the 'Y-model'). We find that, whereas this model and its derivatives have provided new insights, a misunderstanding of the pivotal equation has led to incorrect predictions and faulty tests. Thirdly, we ask how trade-offs are expected to evolve under directional selection. A quantitative genetic model predicts that, under weak or short-term selection, the intercept will change but the slope will remain constant. Two empirical tests support this prediction but these are based on comparisons of geographic populations: more direct tests will come from artificial selection experiments. Finally, we discuss what maintains variation in trade-offs noting that at present little attention has been given to this question. We distinguish between phenotypic and genetic variation and suggest that the latter is most in need of explanation. We suggest that four factors deserving investigation are mutation-selection balance, antagonistic pleiotropy, correlational selection and spatio-temporal variation, but as in the other areas of research on trade-offs, empirical generalizations are impeded by lack of data. Although this lack is discouraging, we suggest that it provides a rich ground for further study and the integration of many disciplines, including the emerging field of genomics.},

abstract = {It has been known for some 70 years that restricting the food intake of laboratory rats extends their mean and maximum life span. In addition, such life extension has been observed over the years in many other species, including mice, hamsters, dogs, fish, invertebrate animals, and yeast. Since this life-extending action appears to be due to a restricted intake of energy, this dietary manipulation is referred to as caloric restriction (CR). CR extends life by slowing and/or delaying the ageing processes. The underlying biological mechanism responsible for the life extension is still not known, although many hypotheses have been proposed. The Growth Retardation Hypothesis, the first proposed, has been tested and found wanting. Although there is strong evidence against the Reduction of Body Fat Hypothesis, efforts have recently been made to resurrect it. While the Reduction of Metabolic Rate Hypothesis is not supported by experimental findings, it nevertheless still has advocates. Currently, the most popular concept is the Oxidative Damage Attenuation Hypothesis; the results of several studies provide support for this hypothesis, while those of other studies do not. The Altered Glucose-Insulin System Hypothesis and the Alteration of the Growth Hormone-IGF-1 Axis Hypothesis have been gaining favor, and data have emerged that link these two hypotheses as one. Thus, it may now be more appropriate to refer to them as the Attenuation of Insulin-Like Signaling Hypothesis. Finally, the Hormesis Hypothesis may provide an overarching concept that embraces several of the other hypotheses as merely specific examples of hormetic processes. For example, the Oxidative Damage Attenuation Hypothesis probably addresses only one of likely many damaging processes that underlie aging. It is proposed that low-intensity stressors, such as CR, activate ancient hormetic defense mechanisms in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals, defending them against a variety of adversities and, when long-term, retarding senescent processes. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Kin selection and parental investment theories state that, in highly social species, such as humans, individuals can increase their inclusive fitness by extending support to their relatives. Here, we document patterns of kin support in a rural Ethiopian community, where postmarital residence practices provide differential access to relatives. Using demographic, anthropometric, and behavioral data collected from four villages we are able to (a) identify the effects of the presence of kin on child mortality and growth patterns and (b) provide detailed information on the role of relatives within the household. Mortality analyses indicate that grandmothers had a positive effect on child survival. Anthropometric data reveal that maternal grandmothers had a particularly beneficial effect on child height, but paternal grandmothers less so. Time allocation data suggest that grandmothers continued to visit their daughters' households, irrespective of postmarital residence, where they relieved their daughters of heavy domestic tasks rather than helping with direct grandchild care. Matrilocal postmarital residence was associated with improved child survival, although children in matrilocal households were actually smaller. This may be due to wealth effects, increased competition between siblings, or higher survival of smaller infants in matrilocal households. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

After longevity and fecundity estimates were controlled for by confounding factors such as historical (i.e. human ethnic groups), religious, geographical, socio-economical and parasitological components, we still observed a negative relationship between the mean female fecundity and the mean longevity in a country.

Animal positions provide the elemental unit of movement paths and show where individuals interact with the ecosystems around them. We discuss how knowing where animals go can help scientists in their search for a mechanistic understanding of key concepts of animal ecology, including resource use, home range and dispersal, and population dynamics. It is probable that in the not-so-distant future, intense sampling of movements coupled with detailed information on habitat features at a variety of scales will allow us to represent an animal's cognitive map of its environment, and the intimate relationship between behaviour and fitness.

abstract = {Trade-offs are central tomany topics in biology, fromthe evolution of life histories to ecologicalmechanisms of species coexistence. Trade-offs observed among species may reflect pervasive constraints on phenotypes that are achievable given biophysical and resource limitations. If so, then among-species trade-offs should be consistent with trade-offs within species. Alternatively, trait variation among co-occurring species may reflect historical contingencies during community assembly rather than within-species constraints. Here, we test whether a key trade-off between relative growth rate (RGR) and water-use efficiency (WUE) among Sonoran Desert winter annual plants is apparent within four species representing different strategies in the system. We grew progeny of maternal families from multiple populations in a greenhouse common garden. One species, Pectocarya recurvata, displayed the expected RGR–WUE trade-off among families within populations. For other species, although RGR and WUE often varied clinally among populations, among-family variation within populations was lacking, implicating a role for past selection on these traits. Our results suggest that a combination of limited genetic variation in single traits and negative trait correlations could pose constraints on the evolution of a high-RGR and high-WUE phenotype within species, providing a microevolutionary explanation for phenotypes that influence community-level patterns of abundance and coexistence.},

abstract = {The breeder's equation, which predicts evolutionary change when a phenotypic covariance exists between a heritable trait and fitness, has provided a key conceptual framework for studies of adaptive microevolution in nature. However, its application requires strong assumptions to be made about the causation of fitness variation. In its univariate form, the breeder's equation assumes that the trait of interest is not correlated with other traits having causal effects on fitness. In its multivariate form, the validity of predicted change rests on the assumption that all such correlated traits have been measured and incorporated into the analysis. Here, we (i) highlight why these assumptions are likely to be seriously violated in studies of natural, rather than artificial, selection and (ii) advocate wider use of the Robertson-Price identity as a more robust, and less assumption-laden, alternative to the breeder's equation for applications in evolutionary ecology.},

abstract = {With its focus on phenotypes, inheritance, and natural selection, evolutionary quantitative genetics constitutes a bridge between the genetic architecture of traits and evolutionary dynamics. This field has produced a vast theoretical literature with numerous empirical studies supporting the basic theoretical principles of quantitative genetics. At minimum, quantitative genetic studies require data concerning phenotype, fitness, and kin relations for individuals in a population. These data are rarely available to primatologists who study primate populations in the wild. Increasingly, however, evolutionary quantitative genetic studies have been conducted on wild and free-ranging primates, and several long-term studies of wild primates are producing the necessary data to conduct quantitative genetic studies. Our goal in this review is to provide a thorough and (hopefully) gentle introduction to quantitative genetic theory, with particular emphasis on multivariate selection theory. We review the basic steps in deriving a multivariate equation for evolutionary change and we then show how this basic equation can be modified in order to study sexual selection, life history theory, evolutionary constraints, allometry, ecological morphology and social behavior. We also discuss the epistemological role of quantitative genetic models as well as basic concepts such as fitness, selection, and adaptation as they pertain to quantitative genetic studies. Finally, we review some recent quantitative genetic studies of wild and free-ranging primates.},

abstract = {Time series of rapid phenotypic change have been documented in age-structured populations living in the wild. Researchers are often interested in identifying the processes responsible for such change. We derive an equation to exactly decompose change in the mean value of a phenotypic trait into contributions from fluctuations in the demographic structure and age-specific viability selection, fertility selection, phenotypic plasticity, and differences between offspring and parental trait values. We treat fitness as a sum of its components rather than as a scalar and explicitly consider age structure by focusing on short time steps, which are appropriate for describing phenotypic change in species with overlapping generations. We apply the method to examine stasis in birth weight in a well-characterized population of red deer. Stasis is achieved because positive viability selection for an increase in birth weight is countered by parents producing offspring that are, on average, smaller than they were at birth. This is one of many ways in which equilibria in the mean value of a phenotypic trait can be maintained. The age-structured Price equation we derive has the potential to provide considerable insight into the processes generating now frequently reported cases of rapid phenotypic change.},

The first is the matrix of nonlinear selection gradients (gamma) which describes the individual fitness surface. The second is the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) that influences the multivariate response to selection. A common approach to the empirical analysis of these matrices is the element-by-element testing of significance, and subsequent biological interpretation of pattern based on these univariate and bivariate parameters. Here, I show why this approach is likely to misrepresent the genetic basis of quantitative traits, and the selection acting on them in many cases. Diagonalization of square matrices is a fundamental aspect of many of the multivariate statistical techniques used by biologists. Applying this, and other related approaches, to the analysis of the structure of gamma and G matrices, gives greater insight into the form and strength of nonlinear selection, and the availability of genetic variance for multiple traits.},

We derive formulas for the variance effective size of populations subject to fluctuations in age structure and total population size produced by a combination of demographic and environmental stochasticity. Haploid and monoecious or dioecious diploid populations are analyzed. Recent results from stochastic demography are employed to derive a two-dimensional diffusion approximation for the joint dynamics of the total population size, N, and the frequency of a selectively neutral allele, p. The infinitesimal variance for p, multiplied by the generation time, yields an expression for the effective population size per generation. This depends on the current value of N, the generation time, demographic stochasticity, and genetic stochasticity due to Mendelian segregation, but is independent of environmental stochasticity. A formula for the effective population size over longer time intervals incorporates deterministic growth and environmental stochasticity to account for changes in N.},

Based on the assumption of small (but frequent) mutations we employ asymptotic analysis to derive a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Well-established and powerful numerical tools for solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equations then allow us to easily compute the evolution of the trait in a monomorphic population when this evolution is continuous but also when the trait exhibits a jump. By adapting the numerical method we can, at the expense of a significantly increased computing time, also capture the branching event in which a monomorphic population turns dimorphic and subsequently follow the evolution of the two traits in the dimorphic population. From the beginning we concentrate on a caricatural yet interesting model for competition for two resources. This provides the perhaps simplest example of branching and has the great advantage that it can be analyzed and understood in detail. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Whole organism performance represents the integration of numerous physiological, morpholog- ical, and behavioral traits. How adaptive changes in performance evolve therefore requires an understanding of how selection acts on multiple integrated traits. Two approaches that lend themselves to studying the evolution of performance in natural populations are the use of quantitative genetics models for estimating the strength of selection acting on multiple quantitative traits and ecological genetic comparisons of popu- lations exhibiting phenotypic differences correlated with environmental variation. In both cases, the ultimate goal is to understand how suites of traits and trade-offs between competing functions respond to natural selection. Here we consider how these two complimentary approaches can be applied to study the adaptive evolution of escape performance in fish. We first present an extension of Arnold's (1983) quantitative genetic approach that explicitly considers how trade-offs between different components of performance interact with the underlying genetics. We propose that such a model can reveal the conditions under which multiple selection pressures will cause adaptive change in traits that influence more than one component of fitness. We then review work on the Atlantic silversides and Trinidadian guppies as two case studies where an ecological genetics approach has been successfully applied to evaluate how the evolution of escape perfor- mance trades-off with other components of fitness. We conclude with the general lesson that whole organism performance is embedded in a complex phenotype, and that the net outcome of selection acting on different aspects of the organism will often result in a compromise among competing influences.

@misc{McGraw1997,
abstract = {Begin with a useful brief survey of the various vague definitions of fitness. Treat fitness as the dominant eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix, and apply this definition to individuals. This seems paradoxical, since the dominant eigenvalue is the rate of increase of a population: any one individual is just born, bears offspring, and dies. McG {\&} C argue that their measure is a fitness associated with the propensity of the individual to bear offspring. Following Popper, they regard their measure as an estimator of a real (but unobservable) quantity. This approach is attractive, However, I have two criticisms. First, only a restricted set of questions can be answered by "long term increase": it is easy to set up models where one needs to know the complicated actual increase over a limited time under varying conditions. Second, their measure is biased. They say this does not matter: but the point is hat knowing the l's of a set of individuals tells one nothing about their collective rate of increase. At the end, they come back to a more traditional view (though without admitting it): to estimate the fitness of an individual by cloning it, or by inference from measurments of a (complete!) set of traits thought to be ecologically relevant. ***** Fitness is a vague, poorly developed concept in ecology and evolutionary biology. Although it is generally recognized that fitness is determined by the complete survival and reproductive schedules of individual organisms, experimental studies have rarely attempted to integrate these into a single measure of individual fitness. Instead, particularly in studies of natural selection, components of fitness are measured as surrogates for fitness. In this article, we develop an integrated measure of fitness based on the philosophical underpinnings provided by the notion of propensity fitness, combined with classical demographic methods. We show how life-history data, collected for an individual, can be formatted as an age-structured population projection matrix, A((m)). The dominant eigenvalue, lambda((m)), of this matrix is an estimate of that individual's propensity fitness. Using life-history data sets on European sparrowhawks and blue tits, we show that the interpretation of analyses of selection can shift radically using the integrated propensity fitness measure instead of components of fitness, such as lifetime reproductive output. Individual fitness, as formulated here, provides an integrated measure of performance that should prove useful in empirical studies in ecology and evolutionary biology.},

However, the demonstration of a genetic basis to this trade-off has been shown in only one species, Gryllus firmus. In this paper we present evidence for another species, the cricket Allonemobius socius. There were significant negative phenotypic correlations between wing morph and fecundity during the first two periods following eclosion (0-12 days and 13-16 days) and also cumulative fecundity (i.e. macropterous females laid fewer eggs than micropterous females). Macropterous and micropterous females did not differ in fecundity during the remaining two periods (17-20 days and 21-24 days). Both wing morph and age-specific fecundities had significant heritabilities. There was a significant negative genetic correlation between wing morph and fecundity during the first 12 days after eclosion. The standard errors of the estimates for the remaining periods were too large to permit a meaningful conclusion. Analysis of family mean data indicated that fecundity did not vary in a dichotomous manner with wing morph but was best described as a continuous function of the underlying continuously distributed trait.},

abstract = {The life history favoured by natural selection maximizes fitness, and this implies maximization of fecundity and survival at all ages. The observed diversity in life histories suggests that there are constraints on what can be achieved in practice. Functional constraints occur if only certain combinations of age-specific fertility and survival are possible, either because of the physiology of the organism or because of the ecological impact of its environment. The resulting constrained optimization means that the organism is involved in making trade-offs between life-history characters. A major task for the future is the measurement of trade-off functions in the environment in which the life-history evolved. Natural variation between individuals and populations, genetic studies and experimental manipulations have all been used to detect trade-offs. The last two methods are the most satisfactory, and can be complementary. Experimental manipulations are at their best when based on sound physiological understanding of the traits under manipulation. Constraints can also operate on the long-term. Local optima, evolutionary lags and irreversible evolution may all have contributed to the diversity of life histories.},

abstract = {The question of how fitness and heritability are related, and especially whether or not there exists additive genetic variance in fitness itself, is fundamental to evolution. Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection postulates that the mean rate of evolutionary change in mean fitness equals the additive genetic variance in fitness itself (Fisher 1930). As a population under natural selection reaches equilibrium, fitness differences approach zero, and consequently additive genetic variance in fitness is soon depleted (Robertson 1955). Most natural popula- tions are probably close to equilibrium, and therefore high values of additive genetic variance may persist only for characters with weak influence on fitness (Falconer 1981). Empirical studies of domestic animals and laboratory popula- tions of Drosophila show lower heritabilities for traits that probably exert some influence on fitness (Falconer 1981). Some evidence suggests that natural popula- tions can maintain quite high levels of heritability for fitness components (Istock 1978; Van Noordwijk et al. 1980). These demonstrations of significant additive genetic variance in fitness components have puzzled population geneticists (Rose 1984). However, there are as yet no estimates of how much variation in traits whose heritability has been estimated can be attributed to variation in individual fitness, that is, how heritability and fitness are related. I studied the heritability of morphological characters, components of fitness, and lifetime reproductive success (i.e., fitness itself) in a natural population of the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). Here I report an inverse relation between the heritability of a trait and its influence on fitness. As predicted, the heritability of lifetime reproductive success was close to zero.},

abstract = {A life-history model from the literature (Schaffer 1974; Charlesworth and Leon 1976) is extended to study the relationship of life-history evolution to age-specific mortality factors. It is shown that an increase in mortality during one age class (j) selects for an increase in reproductive effort before and a decrease after the afflicted age class. However, density dependence in age classes subsequent to j could lead to an increase in reproductive effort for these ages. It is also shown that evolution of reproductive effort leads to the greatest proportionate withdrawal of reproductive value from those adult age classes plagued by new mortality factors. Hence, the commonly observed inverse relationship between reproductive value and mortality is provided with a theoretical underpinning. The smaller the existing survival through age j, the greater the evolutionary sensitivity of reproductive value and reproductive effort to changes in survival through age j. An application of the theory concerns Slobodkin's (1974) hypothesis of prey evolution, prudent predation, which is discussed. Extension of the results to mortality factors which affect multiple age classes is sketched.},

abstract = {It has long been a mystery how Fisher (1930, 1941, 1958) derived his famous ‘fundamental theorem of Natural Selection' and exactly what he meant by it. He stated the theorem in these words (1930, p. 35; 1958, p. 37): ‘The rate of increase inJitness of any organism at any time is equal to its genetic variance injtness at that time.' And also in these words (1930, p. 46; 1958, p. 50): ‘The rate of increase of fitness of any species is equal to the genetic variance in fitness.' He compared this result to the second law of thermodynamics, and described it as holding ‘the supreme position among the biological sciences'. Also, he spoke of the ‘rigour' of his derivation of the theorem and of ‘the ease of its interpretation'. But others have variously described his derivation as ‘recondite' (Crow {\&} Kimura, 1970), ‘very difficult' (Turner, 1970), or ‘entirely obscure' (Kempthorne, 1957). And no one has ever found any other way to derive the result that Fisher seems to state. Hence, many authors (not reviewed here) have maintained that the theorem holds only under very special conditions, while only a few (eg. Edwards, 1967) have thought that Fisher may have been correct -- if only we could understand what he meant ! It will be shown here that this latter view is correct. Fisher's theorem does indeed hold with the generality that he claimed for it. The mystery and the controversy result from incompre- hensibility rather than error. 2.},

@article{Gadgil1970,
abstract = {Abstract Genetically determined polymorphisms incorporating multiple traits can persist in nature under chronic, fluctuating, and sometimes conflicting selection pressures. Balancing selection among morphs preserves equilibrium frequencies, while correlational selection maintains favorable trait combinations within each morph. Under negative frequency-dependent selection, females should mate (often disassortatively) with rare male morphotypes to produce conditionally fit offspring. Conversely, under correlational selection, females should mate assortatively to preserve coadapted gene complexes and avoid ontogenetic conflict. Using controlled breeding designs, we evaluated consequences of assortative mating patterns in color-polymorphic side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana), to identify conflict between these sources of selection. Females who mated disassortatively, and to conditionally high-quality males in the context of frequency-dependent selection, experienced highest fertility rates. In contrast, assortatively mated females experienced higher fetal viability rates. The trade-off between fertility and egg viability resulted in no overall fitness benefit to either assortative or disassortative mating patterns. These results suggest that ongoing conflict between correlational and frequency dependent selection in polymorphic populations may generate a trade-off between rare-morph advantage and phenotypic integration and between assortative and disassortative mating decisions. More generally, interactions among multiple sources of diversity-promoting selection can alter adaptations and dynamics predicted to arise under any of these regimes alone.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The age patterns of lifetime accumulated labor income are relatively stable over time. Both the mean and the standard deviation of remaining lifetime labor income decline with age; the coefficient of variation, measuring variation relative to the mean, increases dramatically with age. The skewness becomes large and positive at older ages. Education level affects all the statistics. About 30{\%} of the variance in lifetime income is due to variance in age-specific income, and about 70{\%} is contributed by the mortality schedule.},

abstract = {Individual-as-maximizing agent analogies result in a simple understanding of the functioning of the biological world. Identifying the conditions under which individuals can be regarded as fitness maximizing agents is thus of considerable interest to biologists. Here, we compare different concepts of fitness maximization, and discuss within a single framework the relationship between Hamilton's (J Theor Biol 7:1–16, 1964) model of social interactions, Grafen's (J Evol Biol 20:1243–1254, 2007a) formal Darwinism project, and the idea of evolutionary stable strategies. We distinguish cases where phenotypic effects are additive separable or not, the latter not being covered by Grafen's analysis. In both cases it is possible to define a maximand, in the form of an objective function ϕ(z), whose argument is the phenotype of an individual and whose derivative is proportional to Hamilton's inclusive fitness effect. However, this maximand can be identified with the expression for fecundity or fitness only in the case of additive separable phenotypic effects, making individual-as-maximizing agent analogies unattractive (although formally correct) under general situations of social interactions. We also feel that there is an inconsistency in Grafen's characterization of the solution of his maximization program by use of inclusive fitness arguments. His results are in conflict with those on evolutionary stable strategies obtained by applying inclusive fitness theory, and can be repaired only by changing the definition of the problem.},

Our main result is to show that the portion of the opportunity for selection that is caused by variation for any trait is equal to the product of its selection gradient and its selection differential. This relationship is a corollary of the first and second fundamental theorems of natural selection, and it permits one to investigate the portions of the total opportunity for selection that are involved in directional selection, stabilizing (and diversifying) selection, and correlational selection, which is important to morphological integration. It also allows one to determine the fraction of fitness variation not explained by variation in measured phenotypes and therefore attributable to random (or, at least, unknown) influences. We apply our methods to a human data set to show how sex-specific mating success as a component of fitness variance can be decoupled from that owing to prereproductive mortality. By quantifying linear sources of sexual selection and quadratic sources of sexual selection, we illustrate that the former is stronger in males, while the latter is stronger in females.},

@article{Champagnat2006,
abstract = {A distinctive signature of living systems is Darwinian evolution, that is, a propensity to generate as well as self-select individual diversity. To capture this essential feature of life while describing the dynamics of populations, mathematical models must be rooted in the microscopic, stochastic description of discrete individuals characterized by one or several adaptive traits and interacting with each other. The simplest models assume asexual reproduction and haploid genetics: an offspring usually inherits the trait values of her progenitor, except when a mutation causes the offspring to take a mutation step to new trait values; selection follows from ecological interactions among individuals. Here we present a rigorous construction of the microscopic population process that captures the probabilistic dynamics over continuous time of birth, mutation, and death, as influenced by the trait values of each individual, and interactions between individuals. A by-product of this formal construction is a general algorithm for efficient numerical simulation of the individual-level model. Once the microscopic process is in place, we derive different macroscopic models of adaptive evolution. These models differ in the renormalization they assume, i.e. in the limits taken, in specific orders, on population size, mutation rate, mutation step, while rescaling time accordingly. The macroscopic models also differ in their mathematical nature: deterministic, in the form of ordinary, integro-, or partial differential equations, or probabilistic, like stochastic partial differential equations or superprocesses. These models include extensions of Kimura's equation (and of its approximation for small mutation effects) to frequency- and density-dependent selection. A novel class of macroscopic models obtains when assuming that individual birth and death occur on a short timescale compared with the timescale of typical population growth. On a timescale of very rare mutations, we establish rigorously the models of "trait substitution sequences" and their approximation known as the "canonical equation of adaptive dynamics". We extend these models to account for mutation bias and random drift between multiple evolutionary attractors. The renormalization approach used in this study also opens promising avenues to study and predict patterns of life-history allometries, thereby bridging individual physiology, genetic variation, and ecological interactions in a common evolutionary framework. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Darwinian evolution is based on three fundamental principles, reproduction, mutation and selection, which describe how populations change over time and how new forms evolve out of old ones. There are numerous mathematical descriptions of the resulting evolutionary dynamics. In this paper, we show that apparently very different formulations are part of a single unified framework. At the center of this framework is the equivalence between the replicator-mutator equation and the Price equation. From these equations, we obtain as special cases adaptive dynamics, evolutionary game dynamics, the Lotka-Volterra equation of ecology and the quasispecies equation of molecular evolution. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Quantitative genetics provides one of the most promising frameworks with which to unify the fields of macroevolution and microevolution. The genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) is crucial to quantitative genetic predictions about macroevolution. In spite of years of study, we still know little about how G evolves. Recent studies have been applying an increasingly phylogenetic perspective and more sophisticated statistical techniques to address G matrix evolution. We propose that a new field, comparative quantitative genetics, has emerged. Here we summarize what is known about several key questions in the field and compare the strengths and weaknesses of the many statistical and conceptual approaches now being employed. Past studies have made it clear that the key question is no longer whether G evolves but rather how fast and in what manner. We highlight the most promising future directions for this emerging field.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. abstract: The observation that traits closely related to fitness (" fit-ness traits ") have lower heritabilities than traits more distantly as-sociated with fitness has traditionally been framed in terms of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection—fitness traits are expected to have low levels of additive genetic variance due to rapid fixation of alleles conferring highest fitness. Subsequent treatments have chal-lenged this view by pointing out that high environmental and non-additive genetic contributions to phenotypic variation may also ex-plain the low heritability of fitness traits. Analysis of a large data set from the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis confirmed a previous finding that traits closely associated with fitness tend to have lower heritability. However, analysis of coefficients of additive genetic var-iation (CV A) revealed that traits closely associated with fitness had higher levels of additive genetic variation (V A) than traits more dis-tantly associated with fitness. Hence, the negative relationship be-tween a trait's association with fitness and its heritability was not due to lower levels of V A in fitness traits but was due to their higher residual variance. However, whether the high residual variance was mainly due to higher levels of environmental variance or due to higher levels of nonadditive genetic variance remains a challenge to be addressed by further studies. Our results are consistent with earlier suggestions that fitness-related traits may have more complex genetic architecture than traits more distantly associated with fitness.},

abstract = {Survival patterns in a population of western gulls (Larus occidentalis) of known age of first breeding, alpha, indicate a cost of reproduction related to the age of initial breeding. Among both sexes, birds that commenced breeding at the earliest ages (3 years in males and 4 years in females) had higher annual mortality than those that deferred breeding one or more years. In addition, females (but not males) evidenced a cumulative cost of reproduction: holding age constant, females with more annual bleeding attempts demonstrated poorer survival. These patterns of alpha-specific survival were statistically significant after controlling for Interannual variation in food availability and are not explained simply by variation in the intrinsic quality of individuals. To assess tie effects of these sex-specific costs on fitness, we combined the observed survival patterns with data on prebreeding survivorship and alpha-specific reproductive success to estimate rates of population growth and lifetime reproductive success for different ages at first reproduction. Males showed a clearly defined fitness optimum at alpha = 4 years, which coincided with the modal cr for males in tile population. Females showed no clear optimum, except that breeding at age 4 was suboptimal, hence females benefited from deferring breeding to ages 5-7 years. Observed age of first breeding also showed no clear made for females, with slight peaks at ages 5 and 7. As a result, in both sexes, the fitness surface for alpha corresponded well with observed frequencies of alpha. We suggest that stabilizing selection has acted to shape thr phenotypic distribution of alpha in males but, due to trade-offs between survival and early reproduction. stabilizing selection Is weak or absent in females.},

In this paper, I show how the mean LRS of the breeding individuals of a population can be calculated from age-specific probabilities of survival and fecundity. An analysis of a simulated population shows that the LRS of males and females from the same population can be different, even though the rates of change in numbers of males and females are identical. Thus, although LRS may be a measure of individual fitness, differences in LRS, even among individuals with different phenotypes and genotypes, cannot be construed to have evolutionary significance. The proper measure of fitness is the Malthusian parameter (mij).},

abstract = {The classification of kin into structured groups is a diverse phenomenon which is ubiquitous in human culture. For populations which are organized into large agropastoral groupings of sedentary residence but not governed within the context of a centralised state, such as our study sample of 83 historical Bantu-speaking groups of sub-Saharan Africa, cultural kinship norms guide all aspects of everyday life and social organization. Such rules operate in part through the use of differing terminological referential systems of familial organization. Although the cross-cultural study of kinship terminology was foundational in Anthropology, few modern studies have made use of statistical advances to further our sparse understanding of the structuring and diversification of terminological systems of kinship over time. In this study we use Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods of phylogenetic comparison to investigate the evolution of Bantu kinship terminology and reconstruct the ancestral state and diversification of cousin terminology in this family of sub-Saharan ethnolinguistic groups. Using a phylogenetic tree of Bantu languages, we then test the prominent hypothesis that structured variation in systems of cousin terminology has co-evolved alongside adaptive change in patterns of descent organization, as well as rules of residence. We find limited support for this hypothesis, and argue that the shaping of systems of kinship terminology is a multifactorial process, concluding with possible avenues of future research.},

abstract = {Optimality theories of ageing predict that the balance between reproductive effort and somatic maintenance determines the rate of ageing. Laboratory studies find that increased reproductive effort shortens lifespan, but through increased short-term mortality rather than ageing. In contrast, high fecundity in early life is associated with accelerated senescence in free-living vertebrates, but these studies are non-experimental. We performed lifelong brood size manipulation in free-living jackdaws. Actuarial senescence – the increase in mortality rate with age – was threefold higher in birds rearing enlarged- compared to reduced broods, confirming a key prediction of the optimality theory of ageing. Our findings contrast with the results of single-year brood size manipulation studies carried out in many species, in which there was no overall discernible manipulation effect on mortality. We suggest that our and previous findings are in agreement with predictions based on the reliability theory of ageing and propose further tests of this proposition.},

abstract = {An important computation on pedigree data is the calculation of condensed identity coefficients, which provide a complete description of the degree of relatedness of two individuals. The applications of condensed identity coefficients range from genetic counseling to disease tracking. Condensed identity coefficients can be computed using linear combinations of generalized kinship coefficients for two, three, four individuals, and two pairs of individuals and there are recursive formulas for computing those generalized kinship coefficients (Karigl, 1981). Path-counting formulas have been proposed for the (generalized) kinship coefficients for two (three) individuals but there have been no path-counting formulas for the other generalized kinship coefficients. It has also been shown that the computation of the (generalized) kinship coefficients for two (three) individuals using path-counting formulas is efficient for large pedigrees, together with path encoding schemes tailored for pedigree graphs. In this paper, we propose a framework for deriving path-counting formulas for generalized kinship coefficients. Then, we present the path-counting formulas for all generalized kinship coefficients for which there are recursive formulas and which are sufficient for computing condensed identity coefficients. We also perform experiments to compare the efficiency of our method with the recursive method for computing condensed identity coefficients on large pedigrees.},

Along with rapidly growing knowledge of genetics and accumulation of genealogy information, pedigree data is becoming increasingly important. In large pedigree graphs, path-based methods for efficiently computing genealogical measurements, such as inbreeding and kinship coefficients of individuals, depend on efficient identification and processing of paths. In this paper, we propose a new compact path encoding scheme on large pedigrees, accompanied by an efficient algorithm for identifying paths. We demonstrate the utilization of our proposed method by applying it to the inbreeding coefficient computation. We present time and space complexity analysis, and also manifest the efficiency of our method for evaluating inbreeding coefficients as compared to previous methods by experimental results using pedigree graphs with real and synthetic data. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that our method is more scalable and efficient than previous methods in terms of time and space requirements.},

abstract = {In natural populations, dispersal tends to be limited so that individuals are in local competition with their neighbours. As a consequence, most behaviours tend to have a social component, e.g. they can be selfish, spiteful, cooperative or altruistic as usually considered in social evolutionary theory. How social behaviours translate into fitness costs and benefits depends considerably on life-history features, as well as on local demographic and ecological conditions. Over the last four decades, evolutionists have been able to explore many of the consequences of these factors for the evolution of social behaviours. In this paper, we first recall the main theoretical concepts required to understand social evolution. We then discuss how life history, demography and ecology promote or inhibit the evolution of helping behaviours, but the arguments developed for helping can be extended to essentially any social trait. The analysis suggests that, on a theoretical level, it is possible to contrast three critical benefit-to-cost ratios beyond which costly helping is selected for (three quantitative rules for the evolution of altruism). But comparison between theoretical results and empirical data has always been difficult in the literature, partly because of the perennial question of the scale at which relatedness should be measured under localized dispersal. We then provide three answers to this question.},

abstract = {Paul Samuelson's (1958) overlapping generations model has turned 50. Seldom has so simple a model been so influential. The paper, in spite of its ripe age, still elicits wonder. Starting from the uncontroversial observation that "we live in a world where new generations are always coming along" Samuelson built a model that violates the credo of the first fundamental welfare theorem with which we still inculcate undergraduates 50 years later. According to Samuelson, all is not necessarily well in the best of market economies: with overlapping generations, even absent the usual suspects such as distortions and market failures, a competitive equilibrium need not be Pareto efficient. Worst of all, this failure of the first welfare theorem in an overlapping generations model occurs in a framework that is, in many ways, more plausible and realistic than the world of agents living synchronous and finite existences in which the theorem is usually proved. Like Mona Lisa's enigmatic smile, the mysterious welfare properties of the overlapping generations model are, to a significant extent, responsible for its popularityalong with the many economic issues it has illuminated in the last half-century. I take it as my brief in this celebratory paper to provide, after a short exposition of the main results of the overlapping generations model under certainty, an explanation of why the welfare properties of the overlapping generations model differ so much from the canonical Arrow-Debreu framework and to review, in a deliberately nonencyclopedic mode, a few striking applications and extensions of Samuelson's deceptively straightforward model.},

Here are presented the circumstances in which microsimulation can be of greater value than the more conventional methods. It is particularly relevant when the results of the process being studied are complex whereas the forces driving it are simple. A particular problem in microsimulation results from the fact that the projections are subject to random variation. Various sources of random variations are examined but the most important is the one we refer to as specification randomness: the more explanatory variables are included in the model, the greater the degree of random variation affecting the output of the model. After a brief survey of the microsimulation models which exist in demography, a number of the essential characteristics of microsimulation are illustrated using the KINSIM model for projecting the future size and structure of kinship networks. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nVan Imhoff (Evert), Post (Wendy). - M{\'{e}}todos de micro-simulaci{\'{o}}n para proyecciones de poblaci{\'{o}}n Algunos de los elementos que distinguen la micro-simulaci{\'{o}}n de la macro-simula- ci{\'{o}}n tradicional son: el uso de muestras en lugar de poblaci{\'{o}}n total, trabajo a nivel de datos individuals en vez de datos agregados y uso de experimentos aleatorios repetidos en lugar de m{\'{e}}dias.

abstract = {Matrix projections allow identification of those phases in the life cycle with a high potential impact on the population growth rate. This impact is assessed by the sensitivity or elasticity of the matrix elements that are computed from life cycle data such as age-dependent survival or fecundity. Covariation among life cycle components, e.g., due to trade-offs, is a main subject of life history theory. Sensitivities or elasticities of matrix elements do not take this covariation into account. Integrated sensitivities and elasticities measure the net effect of a matrix element, combining its direct effect and indirect effects through correlation with other matrix elements. These measures are related to the selection differentials and expected selection responses from quantitative genetics. The use of these measures is illustrated with data on disease resistance in a perennial weed Plantago lan- ceolata, and the demography of killer whale pods.},

Multistate models focus on life histories or trajectories, conceptualized as sequences of states and sequences of transitions between states. Life histories are modeled as realizations of continuous-time Markov processes. The model parameters, transition rates, are estimated from data on event counts and populations at risk, using the statistical theory of counting processes. The Comprehensive R Network Archive (CRAN) includes several packages for multistate modeling. This book is about Biograph. The package is designed to (a) enhance exploratory analysis of life histories and (b) make multistate modeling accessible. The package incorporates utilities that connect to several packages for multistate modeling, including survival, eha, Epi, mvna, etm, mstate, msm, and TraMineR for sequence analysis. The book is a ‘hands-on' presentation of Biograph and the packages listed. It is written from the perspective of the user. To help the user master the techniques and the software, a single data set is used to illustrate the methods and software. It is the subsample of the German Life History Survey, which was also used by Blossfeld and Rohwer in their popular textbook on event history modeling. Another data set, the Netherlands Family and Fertility Survey, is used to illustrate how Biograph can assist in answering questions on life paths of cohorts and individuals. The book is suitable as a textbook for graduate courses on event history analysis and introductory courses on competing risks and multistate models. It may also be used as a self-study book. The R code used in the book is available online. Frans Willekens is affiliated with the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR) in Rostock, Germany. He is Emeritus Professor of Demography at the University of Groningen, a Honorary Fellow of the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (NIDI) in the Hague, and a Research Associate of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Laxenburg, Austria.

abstract = {Body size correlates with virtually every aspect of species biology, so understanding the tempo and mode of its evolution is of key importance in macroecology and macroevolution. Here we use body mass data from 3,473 of 4,510 extant mammalian species and an almost complete species-level phylogeny to determine the best model of log(body mass) evolution across all mammals, split taxonomically and spatially. An early-burst model fits better across all mammals than do models based on either Brownian motion or an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, suggesting that mammals experienced a burst of morphological evolution relatively early in their history that was followed by slower change. We also use spatial models to investigate rates of body mass evolution within ecoregions. These models show that around 50{\%} of the variation in rate can be explained by just a few predictors. High estimated rates are associated with cold, low-lying, species-poor, high-energy, mainland ecoregions. We conclude that the evolution of mammalian body size has been influenced by a complex interplay among geography, climate, and history.},

abstract = {1. Understanding the evolution of life histories requires an assessment of the process that generates variation in life histories. Within-population heterogeneity of life histories can be dynamically generated by stochastic variation of reproduction and survival or be generated by individual differences that are fixed at birth. 2. We show for the kittiwake that dynamic heterogeneity is a sufficient explanation of observed variation of life histories. 3. The total heterogeneity in life histories has a small contribution from reproductive stage dynamics and a large contribution from survival differences. We quantify the diversity in life histories by metrics computed from the generating stochastic process. 4. We show how dynamic heterogeneity can be used as a null model and also how it can lead to positive associations between reproduction and survival across the life span. 5. We believe our approach to identifying the nature of among-individual heterogeneity yields important insights into the forces that generate within-population variation of life-history traits. It provides an alternative to claims that fixed individual differences are a major determinant of heterogeneity in life histories.},

abstract = {Two standard mathematical formulations of kin-selection models can be found. Inclusive fitness is an actor-centred approach, which calculates the fitness effect on a number of recipients of the behaviour of a single actor. Direct fitness is a recipient-centred approach, which calculates the fitness effect on the recipient of the behaviour of a number of actors. Inclusive fitness offers us a powerful heuristic, of choosing behaviour to maximize fitness, but direct fitness can be mathematically easier to work with and has recently emerged as the preferred approach of theoreticians. In this paper, we explore the fundamental connection between these two approaches in both homogeneous and class-structured populations, and we show that under simple assumptions (mainly fair meiosis and weak selection) they provide equivalent formulations, which correspond to the predictions of Price's equation for allele frequency change. We use a couple of examples to highlight differences in their conception and formulation, and we briefly discuss a two-species example in which we have a class of 'actor' that is never a 'recipient', which the standard direct fitness method can handle but the usual inclusive fitness cannot.},

abstract = {A new way of analyzing life histories is presented, based on the use of elasticities as derived from the limit properties of population projection matrices. In general there is not a simple relation between life history traits and matrix elements and their corresponding elasticity values. By recognizing the fact that a life history trait always is part of a life history pathway that can be contrasted to other pathways, this problem can be overcome. The various life history pathways form loops within the life cycle graph, the graphical representation of the projection matrix. It is shown that one can calculate the elasticities of such loops from the single elasticity values in the matrix in an unequivocal way. This presents a new and meaningful decomposition of total elasticity in population projection matrices and provides a potentially powerful tool to evaluate the importance of alternative life history options in demographic studies. This point is demonstrated using two previously published sets of data.},

abstract = {To determine the prevalence of consanguineous marriages and estimate the effects of consanguinity on reproductive behaviour and mortality, household and hospital-based surveys were conducted in 11 cities in the Pakistan province of Punjab between 1979 and 1985. The 9520 women interviewed reported 44,474 pregnancies, with data collected on maternal and paternal ages at marriage, abortions/miscarriages, stillbirths and deaths in the first month, at 2-12 months and 2-8/10 years. Six categories of consanguineous marriage were included: double first cousin, first cousin, first cousin once removed/double second cousin, second cousin, bradari (brotherhood) and non-consanguineous. Marriages contracted between spouses related as second cousins or closer accounted for 50.3{\%} of the total, equivalent to an average coefficient of kinship (alpha = sigma piFi) of 0.0280. Unions between close biological relatives were characterized by younger maternal and paternal ages at marriage and reduced spousal age difference, but a longer time to first delivery. Overall, they exhibited greater fertility than non-consanguineous couples. Antenatal and postnatal mortality were assessed by consanguinity and age interval. Consanguinity-associated deaths were consistently higher in the neonatal, infant and childhood periods. The consequences of these outcomes on the health of the present and future generations is assessed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThere are 20-55{\%} of all unions in Africa and Asia that are marriages between close biological relatives (consanguinity). All major religious groups in Asia, except the Hindus and Sikhs in North India, report consanguineous marriages. In the assessment of the determinants of reproductive behavior and postnatal mortality, retrospective data on 9520 families in 11 cities in Punjab province in Pakistan between 1979 and 1985 were examined. Background variables were age of both partners at age of marriage, spousal age difference, time to first delivery, number of pregnancies, number of abortions/miscarriages, stillbirths, death in the first month, at 2-12 months, and at 2-8/10 years. Consanguinity was defined as marriages between second cousins of closer and included the following: double first cousin, first cousin, first cousin once removed or double second cousin, second cousin, and nonconsanguineous. The results showed that 50.25{\%} of marriages were between second cousins or closer. 37.07{\%} were first cousin marriages, 11.72{\%} were first cousin once removed or second cousin marriages, and .56{\%} were second cousin unions. 33.93{\%} were "bradari" marriages, which denoted fraternal or paternal lines and were classified as nonconsanguineous. Mother's age at first marriage was 18.35 years and father's age at first marriage was 23.28 years for double first cousin unions vs. 19.74 years and 25.97 years, respectively, for nonconsanguineous unions. Spousal age differences were also negatively associated with consanguinity. There were positive associations between mean number of pregnancies and live births and consanguinity. Mortality rose from 16.36{\%} in nonsanguineous pregnancies to 20.09{\%} among second pregnancies, to 22.13{\%} among first cousins, and 38.97{\%} among double first cousins. This findings suggest the expression of harmful recessive genes. Caution is urged in this interpretation because age and socioeconomic status were not controlled. Further data collection and analysis are urgently needed to examine carefully the effects of marriage to a close relative on mortality.},

Mimicking the life history of an individual as it progresses from egg to juvenile to adult instars, the model consists of a coupled pair of nonlinear, nonautonomous ordinary differential equations. The growth of an individual is described through the dynamics of two compartments -lipid and structure- of the organism because of the importance of lipid dynamics in aquatics animals. Energy supply and demand are handled through an energy integrator compartments. Availability of energy is represented by potential flows from the lipid and structural compartments. Energy requirements of maintenance, activity, and reproduction are the sinks. An advantage of employing an individual-based technique is that ample information relating to the individual parameters- most of which are physiological in character- can usually be obtained, and reasonable estimates for models application found.},

abstract = {The "marriage squeeze," or the effect on marriage of an imbalance between the numbers of males and females, has been seen as having a great influence on contemporary marriage behavior. Nonetheless, the literature does not contain a clear definition of exactly what a marriage squeeze is and contains few quantitative estimates of its impact on marriage. The present article provides a precise definition of the marriage squeeze in equation (2), and applies it to measure both artificially produced marriage squeezes in two-sex nuptiality stable populations and the experience of the United States during the period 1950-1990. The marriage squeeze is shown to be capable of producing significant changes in both the level and distribution of marriage, and it appears to be having such an impact in some contemporary Third World societies. For developed countries in general and for the United States in particular, the marriage squeeze exerts little influence on the level of marriage but has a considerable effect on the distribution of marriages. The U.S. age-sex composition of the year 1978, compared to that of the year 1951, is shown to imply a 0.54 year decrease in the male mean age at marriage and a 0.53 year increase in the female mean age at marriage, as well as an 18 percent reduction in the variance of the male ages at marriage and a 33 percent increase in the variance of the female ages. The social and economic implications of such changes have yet to be fully explored.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Population projections using the cohort component method can be written as time-varying matrix population models. The matrices are parameterized by schedules of mortality, fer- tility, immigration, and emigration over the duration of the projection. A variety of de- pendent variables are routinely calculated (the population vector, various weighted popu- lation sizes, dependency ratios, etc.) from such projections. OBJECTIVE Our goal is to derive and apply theory to compute the sensitivity and the elasticity (propor- tional sensitivity) of any projection outcome to changes in any of the parameters, where those changes are applied at any time during the projection interval. METHODS We use matrix calculus to derive a set of equations for the sensitivity and elasticity of any vector valued outcome $\xi$(t) at time t to any perturbation of a parameter vector $\theta$(s) at any time s. RESULTS The results appear in the form of a set of dynamic equations for the derivatives that are integrated in parallel with the dynamic equations for the projection itself. We show re- sults for single-sex projections and for the more detailed case of projections including age distributions for both sexes. We apply the results to a projection of the population of Spain, from 2012 to 2052, prepared by the Instituto Nacional de Estad´ ıstica, and deter- mine the sensitivity and elasticity of (1) total population, (2) the school-age population, (3) the population subject to dementia, (4) the total dependency ratio, and (5) the eco- nomic support ratio. CONCLUSIONS Writing population projections in matrix form makes sensitivity analysis possible. Such analyses are a powerful tool for the exploration of how detailed aspects of the projection output are determined by the mortality, fertility, and migration schedules that underlie the projection.},

@book{Lebreton2009,
abstract = {Many fields of science begin with a phase of exploration and description, followed by investigations of the processes that account for observed patterns. The science of ecology is no exception, and recent decades have seen a focus on understanding key processes underlying the dynamics of ecological systems. In population ecology, emphasis has shifted from the state variable of population size to the demographic processes responsible for changes in this state variable: birth, death, immigration, and emigration. In evolutionary ecology, some of these same demographic processes, rates of birth and death, are also the determinants of fitness. In animal population ecology, the estimation of state variables and their associated vital rates is especially problematic because of the difficulties in sampling such populations and detecting individual animals. Indeed, early capture-recapture models were developed for the purpose of estimating population size, given the reality that all animals are not caught or detected at any sampling occasion. More recently, capture-recapture models for open populations were developed to draw inferences about survival in the face of these same sampling problems. The focus of this paper is on multi-state mark-recapture models (MSMR), which first appeared in the 1970s but have undergone substantial development in the last 15 years. These models were developed to deal explicitly with biological variation, in that animals in different "states" (classes defined by location, physiology, behavior, reproductive status, etc.) may have different probabilities of survival and detection. Animal transitions between states are also stochastic and themselves of interest. These general models have proven to be extremely useful and provide a way of thinking about a remarkably wide range of important ecological processes. These methods are now at a stage of refinement and sophistication where they can readily be used by biologists to tackle a wide range of important issues in ecology. In this paper, we draw together information on the state of the art in multistate mark-recapture methods, explaining the models and illustrating their use. We provide a modeling philosophy and a series of general principles on how to conduct analyses. We cover key issues and features, and we anticipate the ways in which we expect the models to develop in the years ahead. In particular:-MSMR can now be used in a straightforward fashion by population biologists, thanks to the development of sound goodness-of-fit procedures, reliable parameter identifiability diagnostics, and robust user-friendly computer software.Constrained models and model selection procedures can be used in the ANOVA-like philosophy commonly used over the last 15 years for survival models, to answer a variety of biological questions. We develop as an example a treatment of meadow vole Microtus pennsylvanicus data.-As in survival models, random effects should be an integral part of this philosophy. Some simple approaches to random effects are illustrated.-States can be defined in a very general way, for example, by combining several criteria, such as sites and reproductive states, and can include nonobservable states. We develop as an example a multisite recruitment model of roseate terns Sterna dougallii.-MSMR models appear as a natural framework for combining different sources of information, viewed as different events that can be organized into mutually exclusive alternatives.-With the available developments, MSMR models are becoming a standard tool in population biology, as shown by a rapid growth of their use in the literature. In particular, given the ease with which a variety of constrained models can now be developed, MSMR models appear as less data hungry than was often feared.-MSMR models make it also possible to unify a large array of methodology, and, as such, are both a step towards further unification in a "mother of all" model, and a sound basis for further generalizations.-Future developments concern a variety of generalizations such as the reverse time approach and population size estimation. "Multievent" models, accounting for uncertainty in state determination, and integrated state-space models are key generalizations already in full development. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the analysis of organism life cycles in ecology, comparisons of life cycles between species or between different types of life cycles within species are frequently conducted. In matrix population models, partitioning of the elasticity matrix is used to quantify the separate contributions of different life cycles to the population growth rate. Such partition is equivalent to a decomposition of the life cycle graph of the population. A graph theoretic spanning tree method to carry out the decomposition was formalized by Wardle [Ecology 79(7), 2539-2549 (1998)]. However there are difficulties in realizing a suitable decomposition for complex life histories using the spanning-tree method. One of the problems is the occurrence of life cycles that contain contradictory directions that defy biological interpretation. We propose an algorithmic approach for decomposing a directed, weighted graph. The graph is to be decomposed into two parts. The first part is a set of simple cycles that contain no contradictory directions and that consist of edges of equal weight. The second part of the decomposition is a subgraph in which no such simple cycles are obtainable. When applied to life cycle analysis in ecology, the proposed method will guarantee a complete decomposition of the life cycle graph into individual life cycles containing no contradictory directions.},

abstract = {Let A and B two n× n matrices over a ring R (e.g., the reals or the integers) each containing at most m non-zero elements. We present a new algorithm that multiplies A and B using O( m 0.7 n 1.2+ n 2+ o(1)) algebraic operations (i.e., multiplications, additions and subtractions) over R. For m≤ n 1.14, the new algorithm performs an almost optimal number of only n 2+ o(1) operations. For m≤ n 1.68, the new algorithm is also faster than the best known matrix multiplication algorithm for dense matrices which uses O( n 2.38) algebraic operations. The new algorithm is obtained using a surprisingly straightforward combination of a simple combinatorial idea and existing fast rectangular matrix multiplication algorithms. We also obtain improved algorithms for the multiplication of more than two sparse matrices. As the known fast rectangular matrix multiplication algorithms are far from being practical, our result, at least for now, is only of theoretical value.},

To be useful, this chart must allow for the systematic location on one plane of the three classical demographic co-ordinates, namely: the date, the age and the moment of birth. There are three solutions for this problem. In 1869, Zeuner worked out a first solution. In 1870, Brasche proposed a second one with networks of parallels; it is the version most currently used now. In 1874, Becker proposed the third one. In 1875, certainly after Verwey, Lexis took back the Zeuner{\'{i}}s diagram and just added networks of parallels. In spite of all this, the name "Lexis diagram" has imposed itself in a seemingly invincible way.},

Here, I offer a very different explanation.

Because the relevant genes were not on the Y chromosome, life span increased in fe- males as well. However, the female reproductive span was constrained by the depletion of viable oocytes, which resulted in menopause.},

The purpose of this article is to address this issue by establishing upper and lower bounds on the condition number of the chain such that the bounding terms are functions of the eigenvalues of the transition matrix. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how to obtain estimates for the condition number of an irreducible chain with little or no extra computational effort over that required to compute the stationary probabilities by means of an LU or QR factorization.},

The main result relates n to the population's growth rate (i.e. the dominant eigenvalue lamda of the projection matrix) and shows that the stability of the extinction state (the trivial equilibrium) can be determined by whether n is less than or greater than 1. Examples are given to show that explicit algebraic formulas for n are often derivable, and hence available for both numerical and parameter studies of stability, when no such formulas for lamda are available.},

abstract = {We develop a new model of life history evolution to investigate the evolution of age at first reproduction. Density dependence is taken into account. For a given "species", age of maturity, offspring survival, immature survival, adult survival, fecundity, immature age-classes entering in competition with adults and immature competitive ability are traits adjustable by natural selection, and constitute a particular strategy. On the contrary, the type of intraspecific competition (scramble or contest), strength of competition and inherent net reproductive rate Rinh0 are fixed (specific) characteristics. As a consequence of fixing Rinh0, the evolution of any trait will affect trade-offs between others. Evolutionarily stable strategies are determined numerically by using the mathematical concept of Lyapunov exponents. Altogether, we consider 960 different hypothetical "species" (i.e. different combinations of fixed traits). Corresponding ESSs are analyzed with respect to their age at first reproduction, adult survival and immature competitive ability components. They appear to be gathered in three groups. One is intuitive and characterized by a reduction of immature competitive ability and a correlation of age of maturity with adult survival; populations reach mainly equilibria. The two other groups respectively include "species" with low age of maturity but high adult survival, and "species" close to semelparity with delayed maturity; immature competitive ability may not be minimized, and populations possibly exhibit complex dynamics. In conclusion, the hypothesis that the evolution of a demographic parameter modifies trade-offs between others turns out to have important consequences. We argue that life history theory cannot ignore the source and mode-of-operation of density dependence and must regard potential short-term instability as essential. {\textcopyright} 1992 Academic Press Limited.},

Yet the biomathematical literature of the last 10-20 years reflects the implicit acceptance of a common evolutionary framework, the core idea being that there exists a unique general fitness measure that concisely summarizes the overall time course of potential invasions by initially rare mutant phenotypes. Using such an invasion criterion to characterize fitness implicitly presupposes a scenario in which, during periods o f clear evolutionary change, the rate of evolution is set primarily by the random occurrence (and initial establishment) of favourable mutations. Evolutionarily stable life history strategies (ESSs) may then be regarded as traps for the evolutionary random walk.},

abstract = {Senescence is one of the least understood aspects of organism life history. In part, this stems from the relatively late advent of complete individual-level datasets and appropriate statistical tools. In addition, selection against senescence should depend on the contribution to population growth arising from physiological investment in offspring at given ages, but offspring are rarely tracked over their entire lives. Here, we use a multigenerational dataset of preindustrial (1732-1860) Finns to describe the association of maternal age at offspring birth with offspring survival and lifetime reproduction. We then conduct longitudinal analyses to understand the drivers of this association. At the population level, offspring lifetime reproductive success (LRS) declined by 22{\%} and individual $\lambda$, which falls with delays to reproduction, declined by 45{\%} as maternal age at offspring birth increased from 16 to 50 years. These results were mediated by within-mother declines in offspring survival and lifetime reproduction. We also found evidence for modifying effects of offspring sex and maternal socioeconomic status. We suggest that our results emerge from the interaction of physiological with social drivers of offspring LRS, which further weakens selection on late-age reproduction and potentially molds the rate of senescence in humans.},

abstract = {The behavior of Markov chains depends on the transition intensities or probabilities; in applications, these transitions are often written as functions of parameters. In this paper, matrix calculus is used to provide the sensitivities and elasticities of the behavior of continuous time-absorbing Markov chains to arbitrary parameters, which could include the transition intensities themselves or parameters in which those intensi- ties depend. The results include the sensitivity and elasticity of the moments, variances, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation of the time spent in transient states and the time to absorption. The number of visits to transient states is also analyzed, using the embedded discrete-time chain. For models with multiple absorbing states, the sensitivity of the probability of absorption in each absorbing state is presented. As an example, a published model for the progress of colorectal cancer is analyzed in detail. Transient states in this model are defined by disease status, and the model includes two absorbing states: death from cancer and death from other causes. The perturbation analysis provides a quantitative comparison of the effect of changing transition and mortality rates. Such informationmay be useful for evaluating treatment or screening programs.},

abstract = {Mortality plateaus at advanced ages have been found in many species, but their biological causes remain unclear. Here, we exploit age-from-stage methods for organisms with stage-structured demography to study cohort dynamics, obtaining age patterns of mortality by weighting one-period stage-specific survivals by expected age-specific stage structure. Cohort dynamics behave as a killed Markov process. Using as examples two African grasses, one pine tree, a temperate forest perennial herb, and a subtropical shrub in a hurricane-driven forest, we illustrate diverse patterns that may emerge. Age-specific mortality always reaches a plateau at advanced ages, but the plateau may be reached rapidly or slowly, and the trajectory may follow positive or negative senescence along the way. In variable environments, birth state influences mortality at early but not late ages, although its effect on the level of survivorship persists. A new parameter micro omega summarizes the risk of mortality averaged over the entire lifetime in a variable environment. Recent aging models for humans that employ nonobservable abstract states of "vitality" are also known to produce diverse trajectories and similar asymptotic behavior. We discuss connections, contrasts, and implications of our results to these models for the study of aging.},

@article{Martin2006,
abstract = {The evolution of complex organisms is a puzzle for evolutionary theory because beneficial mutations should be less frequent in complex organisms, an effect termed "cost of complexity." However, little is known about how the distribution of mutation fitness effects (f(s)) varies across genomes. The main theoretical framework to address this issue is Fisher's geometric model and related phenotypic landscape models. However, it suffers from several restrictive assumptions. In this paper, we intend to show how several of these limitations may be overcome. We then propose a model of f(s) that extends Fisher's model to account for arbitrary mutational and selective interactions among n traits. We show that these interactions result in f(s) that would be predicted by a much smaller number of independent traits. We test our predictions by comparing empirical f(s) across species of various gene numbers as a surrogate to complexity. This survey reveals, as predicted, that mutations tend to be more deleterious, less variable, and less skewed in higher organisms. However, only limited difference in the shape of f(s) is observed from Escherichia coli to nematodes or fruit flies, a pattern consistent with a model of random phenotypic interactions across many traits. Overall, these results suggest that there may be a cost to phenotypic complexity although much weaker than previously suggested by earlier theoretical works. More generally, the model seems to qualitatively capture and possibly explain the variation of f(s) from lower to higher organisms, which opens a large array of potential applications in evolutionary genetics.},

abstract = {Transposable elements are often considered as selfish DNA sequences able to invade the genome of their host species. Their evolutive dynamics are complex, due to the interaction between their intrinsic amplification capacity, selection at the host level, transposition regulation, and genetic drift. Here, we propose modeling the first steps of TE invasion, i.e., just after a horizontal transfer, when a single copy is present in the genome of one individual. If the element has a constant transposition rate, it will disappear in most cases: the elements with low-transposition rate are frequently lost through genetic drift, while those with high-transposition rate may amplify, leading to the sterility of their host. Elements whose transposition rate is regulated are able to successfully invade the populations, thanks to an initial transposition burst followed by a strong limitation of their activity. Self-regulation or hybrid dysgenesis may thus represent some genome-invasion parasitic strategies.},

abstract = {To quantify the force of selection, Hamilton [Hamilton, W. D. (1966) J. Theor. Biol. 12, 12-45] derived expressions for the change in fitness with respect to age-specific mutations. Hamilton's indicators are decreasing functions of age. He concluded that senescence is inevitable: survival and fertility decline with age. I show that alternative parameterizations of mutational effects lead to indicators that can increase with age. I then consider the case of deleterious mutations with age-specific effects. In this case, it is the balance between mutation and selection pressure that determines the equilibrium number of mutations in a population. In this balance, the effects of different parameterizations cancel out, but only to a linear approximation. I show that mutation accumulation has little impact at ages when this linear approximation holds. When mutation accumulation matters, nonlinear effects become important, and the parameterizations of mutational effects make a difference. The results also suggest that mutation accumulation may be relatively unimportant over most of the reproductive lifespan of any species.},

A variety of these notions, each having a certain motivation with regard to uncertainties inherent in model applications, constitute a hierarchical topology, sometimes very intricate and not yet well-understood, in a formal space of real n ?? n-matrices. As visible forms of this hierarchy, Matrix Flowers are suggested where 'petals' correspond to subsets of particular stability kinds, whose visible inclusion/intersection represent logical implication/junction. The Flowers are constructed under a few simple conventions, and, in the absence of ready characterizations, to draw a 'petal' often poses a challenging mathematical problem, whose solution may reveal a new biological knowledge of a general nature. Particular 'petals' concern the topics of strong and weak interactions in a community, 'key' species in its structure, diffusion instability in its spatial dynamics, where the flower plays a heuristic role in formulating a new problem or/and stimulating a new application. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Demographic analysis methodologies which consider the transient dynamics of a population promise to be highly relevant for population conservation and management, but the present methods of analysis are still in the early stages of being developed. The methods require a knowledge of a population's initial stage-structure, and produce output which is complicated, and difficult to describe succinctly. This paper investigates whether the initial stage-structure is always required in order to obtain reliable information on the transient population dynamics. The paper also presents new methods for succinctly presenting the data from these near-term demographic analyses. The work of Fox and Gurevitch [Am. Naturalist 156 (2000) 242] is extended by deriving an analytical formula which decomposes their near-term sensitivity into two components: one which does not require the populations initial stage-structure to be measured, and one which does. This decomposition is used to estimate the sensitivity of the analysis to the initial population stage structure, without a knowledge of the population structure. The near-term sensitivity analysis is extended to look at several measures for the near-term sensitivity of population growth rate. These new measures allow the information contained in the analysis to be condensed, and for a comparison to be made between near-term and asymptotic sensitivity analyses. The methods are demonstrated by analysing empirical data on the cactus Coryphantha robbinsorum. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Explaining why ageing occurs is a solution to the longstanding enigma of the role of senescence in nature. Even after half a century of progress, this solution continues to unfold. Evolution theory argues strongly against programmed ageing, suggesting instead that organisms are programmed for survival, not death. In the current view, ageing results from the twin principles that (i) the force of natural selection declines with age, and (ii) longevity requires investments in somatic maintenance and repair that must compete against investments in growth, reproduction and activities that might enhance fitness. In addition to explaining why ageing occurs, the evolutionary theory also provides insight into the mechanisms underlying the complex cellular and molecular changes that contribute to senescence, as well as an array of testable predictions. Some of the most interesting current problems are to understand how the genetic factors influencing ageing and longevity are predicted to respond to fluctuating environments, such as temporary periods of famine, as well as to other kinds of spatial and/or temporal heterogeneity. Rapid progress in human genomics raises the prospect of greatly increasing our knowledge of the determinants of human longevity. To make progress in understanding the role and evolution of genetic and non-genetic factors in human longevity, we need more detailed theoretical studies of how intra-population variables, such as socio-economic status, influence the selection forces that shape the life history. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {This paper considers the sensitivity of population growth to small changes in birth, growth, survival, and migration probabilities for an arbitrary population classification (i.e., age, instar, size, developmental stage, age, and spatial location, etc.). The stage-specific life history parameters are expressed in a discrete-time system of linear difference equations, the dominant eigenvalue of which defines the population growth rate. The sensitivity of this eigenvalue to production of class i by class j individuals is shown to be proportional to the product of the reproductive value of stage i and the abundance of stage j in the stable stage distribution. This formula is readily computable, and several examples are presented. For the special case of age-structured populations, this formula reduces to those derived by Hamilton, Emlen, and Goodman.},

abstract = {Current population-forecasting efforts generally adopt minor variants of the cohort-survival projection method. This technique focuses on a population disaggregated into cohorts, a group of people having one or more common characteristics at a point in time and, by subjecting each cohort to class-specific rates of fertility, mortality, and net migration, generates a distribution of survivors and descendants of the original population, at successive intervals of time. Although cohort-survival methods take on a large number of variations, they all are essentially trend-based, dynamic, aspatial models of growth. The temporal element is introduced by a recur- sive structure which operates over a sequence of unit time intervals. The spatial dimension, when it is included at all, typically is accommodated by replicating the analysis over as many areal units as comprise the study area. Realistically, however, time and space need to be considered jointly in population-forecasting models. The need for interregional models which systematically introduce place-to-place movements and simultaneously consider the spatial as well as the tem- poral character of interrelated population processes is becoming increasingly apparent. Recently several demographers have taken advantage of the conceptual elegance and computa- tional simplicity of matrix methods of population analysis. Their models, however, assume a "closed" population which is subject only to the processes of fertility and mortality. These, there- fore, are not directly applicable to interregional "open" systems in which migration is frequently a much more variable and important contributor to population change than births or deaths. How- ever, a natural extension of the demographer's matrix model allows one to incorporate place-to- place migration and provides an integrated interregional population-forecasting model which easily may be programmed for any of the current generation of digital computers. Such a model is outlined in this paper},

abstract = {Abstract Major insights into the relationship between life-history features and fitness have come from Lotka's proof that population growth rate is determined by the level (expected amount) of reproduction and the average timing of reproduction of an individual. But this classical result is limited to age-structured populations. Here we generalize this result to populations structured by stage and age by providing a new, unique measure of reproductive timing (Tc) that, along with net reproductive rate (R0), has a direct mathematical relationship to and approximates growth rate (r). We use simple examples to show how reproductive timing Tc and level R0 are shaped by stage dynamics (individual trait changes), selection on the trait, and parent-offspring phenotypic correlation. We also show how population structure can affect dispersion in reproduction among ages and stages. These macroscopic features of the life history determine population growth rate r and reveal a complex interplay of trait dynamics, timing, and level of reproduction. Our results contribute to a new framework of population and evolutionary dynamics in stage-and-age-structured populations.},

@article{Beuls2013,
abstract = {Grammatical agreement means that features associated with one linguistic unit (for example number or gender) become associated with another unit and then possibly overtly expressed, typically with morphological markers. It is one of the key mechanisms used in many languages to show that certain linguistic units within an utterance grammatically depend on each other. Agreement systems are puzzling because they can be highly complex in terms of what features they use and how they are expressed. Moreover, agreement systems have undergone considerable change in the historical evolution of languages. This article presents language game models with populations of agents in order to find out for what reasons and by what cultural processes and cognitive strategies agreement systems arise. It demonstrates that agreement systems are motivated by the need to minimize combinatorial search and semantic ambiguity, and it shows, for the first time, that once a population of agents adopts a strategy to invent, acquire and coordinate meaningful markers through social learning, linguistic self-organization leads to the spontaneous emergence and cultural transmission of an agreement system. The article also demonstrates how attested grammaticalization phenomena, such as phonetic reduction and conventionalized use of agreement markers, happens as a side effect of additional economizing principles, in particular minimization of articulatory effort and reduction of the marker inventory. More generally, the article illustrates a novel approach for studying how key features of human languages might emerge.},

abstract = {Stage-structured epidemic models provide a way to connect the interacting processes of infection and demography. Reproduction and development can replenish the pool of susceptible hosts, and demo- graphic structure leads to heterogeneous transmission and disease risk. Epidemics, in turn, can increase mortality or reduce fertility of the host population. Herewe present a framework that integrates both demography and epidemiology in models for stage-structured epi- demics. We use the vec-permutation matrix approach to classify individuals jointly by their demographic stage and infection status. We describe demographic and epidemic processes as alternating in time with a pe- riodic matrix model. The application of matrix calculus to this framework allows for the calculation of R0 and sensitivity analysis.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to modeling two-sex populations, using periodic, nonlinear two-sex matrix models. The models project the population growth rate, the population structure, and any ratio of interest (e.g., operational sex ratio). The periodic formulation permits inclusion of highly seasonal behavioral events. A periodic product of the seasonal matrices describes annual population dynamics. The model is nonlinear because mating probability depends on the structure of the population. To study how the vital rates influence population growth rate, population structure, and operational sex ratio, we used sensitivity analysis of frequency-dependent nonlinear models. In nonlinear two-sex models the vital rates affect growth rate directly and also indirectly through effects on the population structure. The indirect effects can sometimes overwhelm the direct effects and are revealed only by nonlinear analysis. We find that the sensitivity of the population growth rate to female survival is negative for the emperor penguin, a species with highly seasonal breeding behavior. This result could not occur in linear models because changes in population structure have no effect on per capita reproduction. Our approach is applicable to ecological and evolutionary studies of any species in which males and females interact in a seasonal environment.},

If the vital rate measures the rate of production of one type of individual by another, then the sensitivity of growth rate is proportional to the reproductive value of the destination type and the representation in the stable stage distribution of the source type. This formal relationship exists in three forms: one limited to age-classified populations, a second that applies to stage- or age-classified populations, and a third that uses matrix calculus.

abstract = {Demography is the study of the population consequences of the fates of individuals. Individuals are differentiated on the basis of age or, in general, life cycle stages. The movement of an individual through its life cycle is a random process, and although the eventual destination (death) is certain, the pathways taken to that destination are stochastic and will differ even between identical individuals; this is individual stochasticity. A stage-classified demographic model contains implicit age-specific information, which can be analyzed using Markov chain methods. The living stages in the life cycles are transient states in an absorbing Markov chain; death is an absorbing state. This paper presents Markov chain methods for computing the mean and variance of the lifetime number of visits to any transient state, the mean and variance of longevity, the net reproductive rate R0, and the cohort generation time. It presents the matrix calculus methods needed to calculate the sensitivity and elasticity of all these indices to any life history parameters. These sensitivities have many uses, including calculation of selection gradients. It is shown that the use of R0 as a measure of fitness or an invasion exponent gives erroneous results except when R0=1. The Markov chain approach is then generalized to variable environments (deterministic environmental sequences, periodic environments, iid random environments, Markovian environments). Variable environments are analyzed using the vec-permutation method to create a model that classifies individuals jointly by the stage and environmental condition. Throughout, examples are presented using the North Atlantic right whale (Eubaleana glacialis) and an endangered prairie plant (Lomatium bradshawii ) in a stochastic fire environment.},

abstract = {Convexity, as a fundamental property of sets and functions defined on convex sets, plays an important role in many mathematical and applied disciplines, including extremal and optimal-control problems. We prove the set of all feasible projection matrices in a general class of matrix models for stage-structured population dynamics to be convex and the dominant eigenvalue (??1) of any projection 2 ?? 2 matrix to be either a convex, or a concave function on a simplex of the matrix first-row entries (i.e., stage-specific reproduction rates). The latter is also conjectured for the general n ?? n case. Though looking far from practical needs of matrix population models, this mathematical result has appeared to be quite useful in solving a practical problem to calibrate the projection matrix, i.e., to estimate all the stage-specific vital rates, from empirical data. The data from monitoring of individual life histories of marked plants on permanent sample plots during successive years enable direct calculation of the stage-specific survival and ontogenetic transition rates, but the rates of reproduction do remain uncertain as far as the parent plants can hardly be determined for the (not yet marked!) recruitment. To overcome this insurmountable uncertainty in data and to conclude the model calibration, we use a general principle that was proposed by Yuri M. Svirezhev in late 70s of the 20th century and applied by his students and followers in a number of applications, namely, to substitute an adaptation conjecture ("empirical generalization") for the lack of data/information. We assume the unobservable stage-specific reproduction rates to be such that they furnish the maximum value to ??1 under certain constraints which ensue from available data and knowledge. The calibration problem hereafter reduces to constraint maximization of ??1 over a bounded convex set of unknown variables (stage-specific reproduction rates), the problem having a unique solution. This solution appears to differ from those proposed by a software package for ecological modelling (RAMAS?? EcoLab), which were based on artificial assumptions of uniformity or singularity in the distribution of the reproduction rates among the stages. Expert knowledge, on the contrary, suggests a certain hierarchy among the rates, and whether the hierarchy admits the population growth can be tested vs. data by means of the former results concerning the potential-growth indicator function. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Perturbation analysis examines the response of a model to changes in its parameters. It is commonly applied to population growth rates calculated from linear models, but there has been no general approach to the analysis of nonlinear models. Nonlinearities in demographic models may arise due to density-dependence, frequency-dependence (in 2-sex models), feedback through the environment or the economy, and recruitment subsidy due to immigration, or from the scaling inherent in calculations of proportional population structure. This paper uses matrix calculus to derive the sensitivity and elasticity of equilibria, cycles, ratios (e.g., dependency ratios), age averages and variances, temporal averages and variances, life expectancies, and population growth rates, for both age-classified and stage-classified models.

I extended this to a fluctuating environment by unifying theories of stochastic demography and fluctuating selection, assuming small or moderate fluctuations in demographic rates with a stationary distribution, and weak selection among the types. The demography of a large population, composed of haploid genotypes at a single locus or normally distributed phenotypes, can then be approximated as a diffusion process and transformed to produce the dynamics of population size, N, and gene frequency, p, or mean phenotype, . The expected evolution of p or is a product of genetic variability and the gradient of the long-run growth rate of the population, , with respect to p or . This shows that the expected evolution maximizes , the mean Malthusian fitness in the average environment minus half the environmental variance in population growth rate. Thus, as a function of p or represents an adaptive topography that, despite environmental fluctuations, does not change with time. The haploid model is dominated by environmental stochasticity, so the expected maximization is not realized. Different constraints on quantitative genetic variability, and stabilizing selection in the average environment, allow evolution of the mean phenotype to undergo a stochastic maximization of . Although the expected evolution maximizes the long-run growth rate of the population, for a genotype or phenotype the long-run growth rate is not a valid measure of fitness in a fluctuating environment. The haploid and quantitative character models both reveal that the expected relative fitness of a type is its Malthusian fitness in the average environment minus the environmental covariance between its growth rate and that of the population.},

It complements comparable methods developed for discrete-time dynamics modelled with matrix or integral projection models. The basic idea behind the method is to use Lotka's integral equation for the population growth rate and compute the integral occurring in that equation by integrating an ordinary differential equation, analogous to recently derived methods to compute steady-states of physiologically structured population models.

abstract = {Despite considerable interest in the dynamics of populations subject to temporally varying environments, alternate population growth rates and their sensitivities remain incompletely understood. For a Markovian environment, we compare and contrast the meanings of the stochastic growth rate (lambdaS), the growth rate of average population (lambdaM), the growth rate for average transition rates (lambdaA), and the growth rate of an aggregate represented by a megamatrix (shown here to equal lambdaM). We distinguish these growth rates by the averages that define them. We illustrate our results using data on an understory shrub in a hurricane-disturbed landscape, employing a range of hurricane frequencies. We demonstrate important differences among growth rates: lambdaS{\textless}lambdaM, but lambdaA can be {\textless} or {\textgreater} lambdaM. We show that stochastic elasticity, ESij, and megamatrix elasticity, EMij, describe a complex perturbation of both means and variances of rates by the same proportion. Megamatrix elasticities respond slightly and stochastic elasticities respond strongly to changing the frequency of disturbance in the habitat (in our example, the frequency of hurricanes). The elasticity EAij of lambdaA does not predict changes in the other elasticities. Because ES, although commonly utilized, is difficult to interpret, we introduce elasticities with a more direct interpretation: ESmu for perturbations of means and ESsigma for variances. We argue that a fundamental tool for studying selection pressures in varying environments is the response of growth rate to vital rates in all habitat states.},

Using a size-structured, individual-based model we show that catastrophic population collapses may nonetheless be an intrinsic property of many communities, because of two general aspects of individual life history: size- and food-dependent individual growth and individual mortality decreasing with body size. Positive density dependence, characteristic for depensatory growth mechanisms and catastrophic behavior, results as a direct and robust consequence of the interplay between these individual life-history traits, which are commonly found in many species.},

abstract = {Multivariate selection models and demographic matrix projections are closely related. The subtle differences among the parameters of both approaches (sensitivities,elasticities, selection differentials, and gradients) can be confusing. I suggest a hierarchicalframework for analysis using elasticity path diagrams, ‘‘elastograms.'' The frameworkcombines selection analysis for the links between phenotypic traits (morphology, behavior)and ﬁtness components (vital rates) with matrix analysis for the relationship between ﬁtnesscomponents and population growth rate/ﬁtness.Elasticities are often used to quantify the impact of a transition rate in the projectionmatrix on the population growth rate (l). Elasticities for underlying ﬁtness componentssuch as fecundity and survival rates can be derived from their connection with the transitionmatrix entries. Yet other traits may affectldue to a functional relationship with one ormore components of ﬁtness; for instance, the timing of ﬂowering of a plant may affect itsseed yield. Elasticities can also be used to quantify the effects of such traits: they can beinterpreted as selection gradients for traits expressed on a proportional (mean-standardized)scale. ‘‘Evolvabilities'' (additive genetic variation in mean-standardized traits), rather thanthe heritabilities of traits, are needed to predict expected selection responses from theelasticities.Elasticities quantify the direct effect of a focal trait onl. Integrated elasticities measurethe impact of a trait through both its direct and indirect effects. This requires knowledgeof the correlations among traits. Matrix projections and selection analysis (through multipleregression or path analysis) can be merged into an elasticity path diagram that summarizesthe hierarchical relationships among traits and ﬁtness. Such diagrams facilitate the iden-tiﬁcation of those traits that have the highest impact on the life cycle of the study organismand can be a tool to deﬁne the targets of management practices, as well as an aid incomparative life history research.},

abstract = {The formalism of Markov chains is presented as a mathematical description of a succession process with a known scheme of successional transitions and their time characteristics. The basic hypotheses and assumptions behind the formalism are formulated and discussed from the viewpoint of the prognostic potential in the resulting models. Fundamental mathematical results from the theory of stochastic processes guarantee the existence of a stationary probability distribution of states in any finite, regular, time-homogeneous Markov chain, and any initial distribution of chain states does converge to some stationary distribution, matching the paradigm of classical succession theory. We propose a general method for estimation of time-homogeneous transition probabilities applicable for any kind of successional scheme, yet with strong requirements to the expert data: average duration times should be known for each specified stage of succession as well as the likelihood proportions among the transitions from the ramifying states of the scheme. Constructed by this method on a single set of data, the discrete- and continuous-time models are proved to converge to the identical distributions, while the average sojourn times in each state are shown to be also the same in the two models. Succession through forest types in a mixed (coniferous-deciduous) forest in Central Russia is considered as an example. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Aggregation methods try to approximate a large scale dynamical system, the general system, involving many coupled variables by a reduced system, the aggregated system, that describes the dynamics of a few global variables. Approximate aggregation can be performed when different time scales are involved in the dynamics of the general system. Aggregation methods have been developed for general continuous time systems, systems of ordinary differential equations, and for linear discrete time models, with applications in population dynamics. In this contribution, we present aggregation methods for linear and nonlinear discrete time models. We present discrete time models with two different time scales, the fast one considered linear and the slow one, generally, nonlinear. We transform the system to make the global variables appear, and use a version of center manifold theory to build up the aggregated system in the nonlinear case. Simple forms of the aggregated system are enough for the local study of the asymptotic behaviour of the general system, provided that it has certain stability under perturbations. In linear models, the asymptotic behaviours of the general and the aggregated systems are characterized by their dominant eigenelements, that are proved to coincide to a certain order. The general method is applied to aggregate a multiregional Leslie model in the constant rates case (linear) and also in the density dependent case (nonlinear).},

I argue that the conditions which lead to these diffusive instabilities are likely to be met in natural populations. Thus it is important to consider the interaction between age structure and spatial structure in both experimental and theoretical work. In particular, the conditions leading to chaos are more common than would be predicted in models which ignore structure. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

abstract = {The production of offspring is energetically costly and relies on incompletely understood mechanisms that generate a positive energy balance. In mothers of many species, changes in key energy-associated internal organs are common yet poorly characterised functionally and mechanistically. In this study, we show that, in adult Drosophila females, the midgut is dramatically remodelled to enhance reproductive output. In contrast to extant models, organ remodelling does not occur in response to increased nutrient intake and/or offspring demands, but rather precedes them. With spatially and temporally directed manipulations, we identify juvenile hormone (JH) as an anticipatory endocrine signal released after mating. Acting through intestinal bHLH-PAS domain proteins Methoprene-tolerant (Met) and Germ cell-expressed (Gce), JH signals directly to intestinal progenitors to yield a larger organ, and adjusts gene expression and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity in enterocytes to support increased lipid metabolism. Our findings identify a metabolically significant paradigm of adult somatic organ remodelling linking hormonal signals, epithelial plasticity, and reproductive output.},

abstract = {The trade-off between survival and reproduction is fundamental to life history theory. Sexual selection is expected to favour a 'live fast die young' life history pattern in males due to increased risk of extrinsic mortality associated with obtaining mates. Sexual conflict may also drive a genetic trade-off between reproduction and lifespan in females. We found significant additive genetic variance in longevity independent of lifetime mating frequency, and in early life mating frequency. There was significant negative genetic covariance between these traits indicating that females from families characterized by high levels of multiple mating early in life die sooner than females that engage in less intense early life mating. Thus, despite heritable variation in both traits, their independent evolution is constrained by an evolutionary trade-off. Our findings indicate that, in addition to the well-known male-driven direct costs of mating on female lifespan (mediated by male harassment and harmful effects of seminal fluids), females with a genetic propensity to mate multiply live shorter lives. We discuss the potential role of sexual conflict in driving the evolutionary trade-off between reproduction and lifespan in Drosophila. More generally, our data show that, like males, females can exhibit a live fast die young life history strategy.},

abstract = {The Price equation partitions total evolutionary change into two components. The first component provides an abstract expression of natural selection. The second component subsumes all other evolutionary processes, including changes during transmission. The natural selection component is often used in applications. Those applications attract widespread interest for their simplicity of expression and ease of interpretation. Those same applications attract widespread criticism by dropping the second component of evolutionary change and by leaving unspecified the detailed assumptions needed for a complete study of dynamics. Controversies over approximation and dynamics have nothing to do with the Price equation itself, which is simply a mathematical equivalence relation for total evolutionary change expressed in an alternative form. Disagreements about approach have to do with the tension between the relative valuation of abstract versus concrete analyses. The Price equation's greatest value has been on the abstract side, particularly the invariance relations that illuminate the understanding of natural selection. Those abstract insights lay the foundation for applications in terms of kin selection, information theory interpretations of natural selection and partitions of causes by path analysis. I discuss recent critiques of the Price equation by Nowak and van Veelen.},

@article{Lawson2012,
abstract = {Evolutionary models of human reproduction argue that variation in fertility can be understood as the local optimization of a life-history trade-off between offspring quantity and 'quality'. Child survival is a fundamental dimension of quality in these models as early-life mortality represents a crucial selective bottleneck in human evolution. This perspective is well-rehearsed, but current literature presents mixed evidence for a trade-off between fertility and child survival, and little empirical ground to evaluate how socioecological and individual characteristics influence the benefits of fertility limitation. By compiling demographic survey data, we demonstrate robust negative relationships between fertility and child survival across 27 sub-Saharan African countries. Our analyses suggest this relationship is primarily accounted for by offspring competition for parental investment, rather than by reverse causal mechanisms. We also find that the trade-off increases in relative magnitude as national mortality declines and maternal somatic (height) and extrasomatic (education) capital increase. This supports the idea that socioeconomic development, and associated reductions in extrinsic child mortality, favour reduced fertility by increasing the relative returns to parental investment. Observed fertility, however, falls considerably short of predicted optima for maximizing total offspring survivorship, strongly suggesting that additional unmeasured costs of reproduction ultimately constrain the evolution of human family size.},

@article{Jones2009,
abstract = {In this article, I present evidence for a robust and quite general force of selection on the human life cycle. The force of selection acts in remarkably invariant ways on human life histories, despite a great abundance of demographic diversity. Human life histories are highly structured, with mortality and fertility changing substantially through the life cycle. This structure necessitates the use of structured population models to understand human life history evolution. Using such structured models, I find that the vital rates to which fitness is most sensitive are prereproductive survival probabilities, particularly the survival of children ages 0 to 4 years. The fact that the preponderance of selection falls on transitions related to recruitment combined with the late age at first reproduction characteristic of the human life cycle creates a fitness bottleneck out of recruitment. Because of this, antagonistic pleiotropy with any trait that detracts from the constituent transitions to recruitment is expected. I explore the predictors of variation in the force of selection on early survival. High fertility increases the selective premium placed on early survivorship, whereas high life expectancy at birth decreases it. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We characterize the behavior of these models in terms of their equilibria, bifurcations, and nonlinear dynamics, for a wide range of parameters. Our analyses lead to several generalizations about the effects of life history and density dependence on population dynamics. Among these are: (1) iteroparous life histories are more likely to be stable than semelparous life histories; (2) an increase in juvenile survivorship tends to be stabilizing; (3) density-dependent adult survival cannot control population growth when reproductive output is high; (4) density-dependent reproduction is more likely to cause chaotic dynamics than density dependence in other vital rates; and (5) changes in development rate have only small effects on bifurcation patterns.},

Using two quantitative indices, we examine time series from a Tribolium experiment for evidence of the predicted saddle node.

For a vital rate following a correlated two state Markov process the joint distributions of age structure and environment are found analytically to be singular steplike functions; again a threshold marks a transition to a smooth function. For fecundities which are serially uncorrelated but continuously distributed the age structure distribution is obtained as a smooth analytic function for all parameter values.

This interpretation leads to a variation of the Lanczos procedure which may frequently be advantageous by virtue of reducing the volume of numerical work in practical applications. Both methods employ essentially the same algorithm, requiring the generation of a series of orthogonal functions through which a simple matrix equation of reduced order is established. The reduced matrix equation may be solved directly in terms of certain polynomial functions obtained in conjunction with the generated orthogonal functions, and the convergence of the solution may be observed as the order of the reduced matrix is successively increased with the order of the original matrix as a limit. The method of minimized iterations is recommended as a rapid means for determining a small number of the larger eigenvalues and modal columns of a large matrix and as a desirable alternative for various series expansions of the Fredholm problem},

Gompertz's work played an important role in shaping the emerging statistical science that underpins the pricing of life insurance and annuities. Latterly, as the subject of ageing itself became the focus of scientific study, the Gompertz model provided a powerful stimulus to examine the patterns of death across the life course not only in humans but also in a wide range of other organisms. The idea that the Gompertz model might constitute a fundamental 'law of mortality' has given way to the recognition that other patterns exist, not only across the species range but also in advanced old age. Nevertheless, Gompertz's way of representing the function expressive of the pattern of much of adult mortality retains considerable relevance for studying the factors that influence the intrinsic biology of ageing. This commentary was written to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.},
